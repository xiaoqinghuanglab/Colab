Telephone: 404-639-1898; Email: \\nkgw2@cdc.gov.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe term “sexually transmitted infection” (STI) refers to \\n\\na pathogen that causes infection through sexual contact, \\nwhereas the term “sexually transmitted disease” (STD) refers \\nto a recognizable disease state that has developed from an \\ninfection. Physicians and other health care providers have a \\ncrucial role in preventing and treating STIs. These guidelines \\nare intended to assist with that effort. Although the guidelines \\nemphasize treatment, prevention strategies and diagnostic \\nrecommendations also are discussed.\\n\\nThis report updates Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment \\nGuidelines, 2015 (1) and should be regarded as a source of \\nclinical guidance rather than prescriptive standards. Health care \\nproviders should always consider the clinical circumstances of \\neach person in the context of local disease prevalence. These \\nguidelines are applicable to any patient care setting that serves \\npersons at risk for STIs, including family planning clinics, \\nHIV care clinics, correctional health care settings, private \\nphysicians’ offices, Federally Qualified Health Centers, clinics \\nfor adolescent care, and other primary care facilities. These \\nguidelines are focused on treatment and counseling and do \\nnot address other community services and interventions that \\nare essential to STI and HIV prevention efforts.\\n\\nThese STI treatment guidelines complement Recommendations \\nfor Providing Quality Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinical \\nServices, 2020 (2) regarding quality clinical services for STIs \\nin primary care and STD specialty care settings. This guidance \\nspecifies operational determinants of quality services in various \\nclinical settings, describes on-site treatment and partner \\nservices, and indicates when STI-related conditions should be \\nmanaged through consultation with or referral to a specialist.\\n\\nMethods\\nThese guidelines were developed by CDC staff who worked \\n\\nwith subject matter experts with expertise in STI clinical \\nmanagement from other federal agencies, nongovernmental \\nacademic and research institutions, and professional medical \\norganizations. CDC staff identified governmental and \\nnongovernmental subject matter experts on the basis of their \\nexpertise and assisted them in developing questions to guide \\nindividual literature reviews. CDC staff informed the subject \\nmatter experts that they were being consulted to exchange \\ninformation and observations and to obtain their individual \\ninput. All subject matter experts disclosed potential conflicts \\nof interest. STI Treatment Guidelines, 2021, Work Group \\nmembers are listed at the end of this report.\\n\\nIn 2018, CDC staff identified key questions about treatment \\nand clinical management to guide an update of the 2015 \\nSTD treatment guidelines (1). To answer these questions \\nand synthesize new information available since publication \\nof the 2015 guidelines, subject matter experts and CDC staff \\n\\nmailto:kgw2@cdc.gov\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n2 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ncollaborated to conduct systematic literature reviews by using \\nan extensive MEDLINE database evidence-based approach for \\neach section of the 2015 guidelines (e.g., using English-language \\npublished abstracts and peer reviewed journal articles). These \\nsystematic reviews were focused on four principal outcomes \\nof STI therapy for each disease or infection: 1) treatment \\nof infection on the basis of microbiologic eradication; \\n2) alleviation of signs and symptoms; 3) prevention of sequelae; \\nand 4) prevention of transmission, including advantages (e.g., \\ncost-effectiveness, single-dose formulations, and directly \\nobserved therapy) and disadvantages (e.g., adverse effects) \\nof specific regimens. The outcome of the literature reviews \\nguided development of background materials, including tables \\nof evidence from peer-reviewed publications summarizing \\nthe type of study (e.g., randomized controlled trial or case \\nseries), study population and setting, treatments or other \\ninterventions, outcome measures assessed, reported findings, \\nand weaknesses and biases in study design and analysis.\\n\\nIn June 2019, the subject matter experts presented their \\nassessments of the literature reviews at an in-person meeting \\nof governmental and nongovernmental participants. Each \\nkey question was discussed and pertinent publications were \\nreviewed in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and relevance. \\nParticipants evaluated the quality of evidence, provided their \\ninput, and discussed findings in the context of the modified \\nrating system used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \\n(USPSTF). The discussions were informal and not structured \\nto reach consensus. CDC staff also reviewed the publications \\nfrom other professional organizations, including the American \\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF, \\nthe American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society \\nfor Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and the \\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). \\nThe discussion culminated in a list of participants’ opinions \\non all the key STI topic areas for consideration by CDC. \\n(More detailed descriptions of the key questions, search terms, \\nsystematic search, evidence tables, and review process are \\navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/\\ndefault.htm).\\n\\nCDC staff then independently reviewed the tables of evidence \\nprepared by the subject matter experts, individual comments \\nfrom the participants and professional organizations, and existing \\nguidelines from other organizations to determine whether \\nrevisions to the 2015 STD treatment guidelines were warranted. \\nCDC staff ranked evidence as high, medium, and low on the \\nbasis of each study’s strengths and weaknesses according to the \\nUSPSTF ratings (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.\\norg/uspstf/us-preventive-services-task-force-ratings). CDC staff \\nthen developed draft recommendations that were peer reviewed \\nby public health and clinical experts as defined by the Office of \\n\\nManagement and Budget for influential scientific information. \\nA public webinar was held to provide an overview of the draft \\nrecommendations and invite questions and comments on the \\ndraft recommendations. The peer review comments, webinar, \\nquestions, and responses were considered by CDC staff in \\ndeveloping the final recommendations for the updated STI \\ntreatment guidelines. Recommendations for HIV, hepatitis C, \\ncervical cancer screening, STI screening in pregnancy, human \\npapillomavirus (HPV) testing, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) and \\nhepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination were developed after CDC \\nstaff reviewed existing published recommendations. The English-\\nlanguage literature was searched periodically by CDC staff to \\nidentify subsequently published articles warranting consideration.\\n\\nThroughout this report, the evidence used as the basis for \\nspecific recommendations is discussed briefly. Publication \\nof comprehensive, annotated discussions of such evidence \\nis planned in a supplemental issue of the journal Clinical \\nInfectious Diseases after publication of the treatment guidelines. \\nWhen more than one therapeutic regimen is recommended \\nand the listed regimens have similar efficacy and similar \\nrates of intolerance or toxicity, the recommendations are \\nlisted alphabetically. If differences are specified, regimens are \\nprioritized on the basis of these differences. Recommended \\nregimens should be used primarily; alternative regimens can be \\nconsidered in instances of notable drug allergy or other medical \\ncontraindications to the recommended regimens. Alternative \\nregimens are considered inferior to recommended regimens on \\nthe basis of available evidence regarding the principal outcomes \\nand disadvantages of the regimens.\\n\\nClinical Prevention Guidance\\nPrevention and control of STIs are based on the following \\n\\nfive major strategies (3):\\n1. Accurate risk assessment and education and counseling \\n\\nof persons at risk regarding ways to avoid STIs through \\nchanges in sexual behaviors and use of recommended \\nprevention services\\n\\n2. Pre-exposure vaccination for vaccine-preventable STIs\\n3. Identification of persons with an asymptomatic \\n\\ninfection and persons with symptoms associated with \\nan STI\\n\\n4. Effective diagnosis, treatment, counseling, and follow-\\nup of persons who are infected with an STI\\n\\n5. Evaluation, treatment, and counseling of sex partners \\nof persons who are infected with an STI\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/default.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/default.htm\\nhttps://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/us-preventive-services-task-force-ratings\\nhttps://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/us-preventive-services-task-force-ratings\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 3US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nSTI and HIV Infection Risk Assessment\\nPrimary prevention of STIs includes assessment of behavioral \\n\\nrisk (i.e., assessing the sexual behaviors that can place persons \\nat risk for infection) and biologic risk (i.e., testing for risk \\nmarkers for STI and HIV acquisition or transmission). As part \\nof the clinical encounter, health care providers should routinely \\nobtain sexual histories from their patients and address risk \\nreduction as indicated in this report. Guidance for obtaining \\na sexual history is available at the Division of STD Prevention \\nresource page (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/resources.\\nhtm) and in the curriculum provided by the National Network \\nof STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers (https://www.\\nnnptc.org). Effective interviewing and counseling skills, \\ncharacterized by respect, compassion, and a nonjudgmental \\nattitude toward all patients, are essential to obtaining a \\nthorough sexual history and delivering effective prevention \\nmessages. Effective techniques for facilitating rapport with \\npatients include using open-ended questions (e.g., “Tell me \\nabout any new sex partners you’ve had since your last visit” and \\n“What has your experience with using condoms been like?”); \\nunderstandable, nonjudgmental language (e.g., “What gender \\nare your sex partners?”and “Have you ever had a sore or scab \\non your penis?”); and normalizing language (e.g., “Some of my \\npatients have difficulty using a condom with every sex act. How \\n\\nis it for you?”). The “Five P’s” approach to obtaining a sexual \\nhistory is one strategy for eliciting information about the key \\nareas of interest (Box 1). In addition, health care professionals \\ncan consider assessing sexual history by asking patients such \\nquestions as, “Do you have any questions or concerns about \\nyour sexual health?” Additional information about gaining \\ncultural competency when working with certain populations \\n(e.g., gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men \\n[MSM]; women who have sex with women [WSW] or with \\nwomen and men [WSWM]; or transgender men and women \\nor adolescents) is available in sections of these guidelines related \\nto these populations.\\n\\nIn addition to obtaining a behavioral risk assessment, a \\ncomprehensive STI and HIV risk assessment should include \\nSTI screening as recommended in these guidelines because \\nSTIs are biologic markers of risk, particularly for HIV \\nacquisition and transmission among certain MSM. In most \\nclinical settings, STI screening is an essential and underused \\ncomponent of an STI and HIV risk assessment. Persons \\nseeking treatment or evaluation for a particular STI should be \\nscreened for HIV and other STIs as indicated by community \\nprevalence and individual risk factors (see Chlamydial \\nInfections; Gonococcal Infections; Syphilis). Persons should \\nbe informed about all the tests for STIs they are receiving and \\nnotified about tests for common STIs (e.g., genital herpes, \\n\\nBOX 1.

Persons should be informed of their test \\nresults and recommendations for future testing. Efforts should \\nbe made to ensure that all persons receive STI care regardless \\nof personal circumstances (e.g., ability to pay, citizenship \\nor immigration status, gender identity, language spoken, or \\nspecific sex practices).\\n\\nSTI and HIV Infection \\nPrevention Counseling\\n\\nAfter obtaining a sexual history from their patients, all \\nproviders should encourage risk reduction by offering \\nprevention counseling. Prevention counseling is most effective \\nif provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner \\nappropriate to the patient’s culture, language, sex and gender \\nidentity, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. \\nPrevention counseling for STIs and HIV should be offered \\nto all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have \\nreceived an STI diagnosis, have had an STI during the \\nprevious year, or have had multiple sex partners. USPSTF \\nrecommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually \\nactive adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs and \\nHIV (4). Such interactive counseling, which can be resource \\nintensive, is directed at a person’s risk, the situations in which \\nrisk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies. \\nOne such approach, known as client-centered STI and HIV \\nprevention counseling, involves tailoring a discussion of risk \\nreduction to the person’s situation. Although one large study in \\nSTI clinics (Project RESPECT) demonstrated that this approach \\nwas associated with lower acquisition of curable STIs (e.g., \\ntrichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) (5), another \\nstudy conducted 10 years later in the same settings but different \\ncontexts (Project AWARE) did not replicate this result (6).\\n\\nWith the challenges that intensive behavioral counseling poses, \\nhealth care professionals might find brief prevention messages \\nand those delivered through video or in a group session to be \\nmore accessible for the client. A review of 11 studies evaluated \\nbrief prevention messages delivered by providers and health \\ncounselors and reported them to be feasible and to decrease \\nsubsequent STIs in STD clinic settings (7) and HIV care \\nsettings (8). Other approaches use motivational interviewing \\nto move clients toward achievable risk-reduction goals. Client-\\ncentered counseling and motivational interviewing can be used \\neffectively by clinicians and staff trained in these approaches. \\nCDC provides additional information on these and other \\neffective behavioral interventions at https://www.cdc.gov/\\nstd/program/interventions.htm. Training in client-centered \\ncounseling and motivational interviewing is available through \\n\\nthe STD National Network of Prevention Training Centers \\n(https://www.nnptc.org).\\n\\nIn addition to one-on-one STI and HIV prevention \\ncounseling, videos and large group presentations can provide \\nexplicit information concerning STIs and reducing disease \\ntransmission (e.g., how to use condoms consistently and \\ncorrectly and the importance of routine screening). Group-\\nbased strategies have been effective in reducing the occurrence \\nof STIs among persons at risk, including those attending \\nSTD clinics (9). Brief, online, electronic-learning modules for \\nyoung MSM have been reported to be effective in reducing \\nincident STIs and offer a convenient client platform for \\neffective interventions (10). Because the incidence of certain \\nSTIs, most notably syphilis, is higher among persons with \\nHIV infection, use of client-centered STI counseling for \\npersons with HIV continues to be encouraged by public health \\nagencies and other health organizations (https://www.cdc.gov/\\nstd/statistics/2019/default.htm). A 2014 guideline from CDC, \\nthe Health Resources and Services Administration, and the \\nNational Institutes of Health recommends that clinical and \\nnonclinical providers assess a person’s behavioral and biologic \\nrisks for acquiring or transmitting STIs and HIV, including \\nhaving sex without condoms, having recent STIs, and having \\npartners recently treated for STIs (https://stacks.cdc.gov/\\nview/cdc/44064). That federal guideline is for clinical and \\nnonclinical providers to offer or make referral for regular \\nscreening for multiple STIs, on-site STI treatment when \\nindicated, and risk-reduction interventions tailored to the \\nperson’s risks. Brief risk-reduction counseling delivered by \\nmedical providers during HIV primary care visits, coupled \\nwith routine STI screening, has been reported to reduce STI \\nincidence among persons with HIV infection (8). Other \\nspecific methods have been designed for the HIV care setting \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/effective-interventions/index.html).\\n\\nPrimary Prevention Methods\\nPre-Exposure Vaccination\\n\\nPre-exposure vaccination is one of the most effective methods \\nfor preventing transmission of HPV, HAV, and HBV, all \\nof which can be sexually transmitted. HPV vaccination is \\nrecommended routinely for males and females aged 11 or \\n12 years and can be administered beginning at age 9 years. \\nHPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for \\nthose not previously vaccinated (11). Sharing clinical decision-\\nmaking about HPV vaccination is recommended for certain \\nadults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated \\nin accordance with existing guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/\\nvaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/program/interventions.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/program/interventions.htm\\nhttps://www.nnptc.org\\nhttps://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44064\\nhttps://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44064\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/effective-interventions/index.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 5US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated, \\nuninfected persons who are sexually active with more than \\none partner or are being evaluated or treated for an STI (12). \\nIn addition, hepatitis A and B vaccines are recommended for \\nMSM, persons who inject drugs, persons with chronic liver \\ndisease, and persons with HIV or hepatitis C infections who \\nhave not had hepatitis A or hepatitis B (12). HAV vaccine is \\nalso recommended for persons who are homeless (13). Details \\nregarding HAV and HBV vaccination, including routine \\nchildhood vaccination, are available at https://www.cdc.gov/\\nhepatitis and at the ACIP website (https://www.cdc.gov/\\nvaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/index.html).\\n\\nCondoms\\n\\nExternal Condoms\\nWhen used consistently and correctly, external latex \\n\\ncondoms, also known as male condoms, are effective in \\npreventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection (http://\\nwww.ashasexualhealth.org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.\\npdf). In heterosexual HIV mixed-status relationships (i.e., those \\ninvolving one infected and one uninfected partner) in which \\ncondoms were used consistently, HIV-negative partners were \\n71%–80% less likely to become infected with HIV, compared \\nwith persons in similar relationships in which condoms were \\nnot used (14,15). Two analyses of MSM mixed-status couple \\nstudies estimated the protective effect of condom use to be 70% \\nand 91%, respectively (16,17). Moreover, studies demonstrate \\nthat consistent condom use reduces the risk for other STIs, \\nincluding chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and trichomoniasis \\n(18–21). By limiting lower genital tract infections, condoms \\nalso might reduce the risk for pelvic inflammatory disease \\n(PID) among women (22). In addition, consistent and correct \\nuse of latex condoms reduces the risk for HPV infection \\nand HPV-associated diseases, genital herpes, syphilis, and \\nchancroid when the infected area or site of potential exposure \\nis covered (23–27). Additional information is available at \\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/index.html and \\nwww.factsaboutcondoms.com/professional.php. Condoms \\nare regulated as medical devices and are subject to random \\nsampling and testing by the Food and Drug Administration \\n(FDA). Each latex condom manufactured in the United States \\nis tested electronically for holes before packaging. The rate of \\ncondom breakage during sexual intercourse and withdrawal in \\nthe United States is approximately two broken condoms per \\n100 condoms. Rates of breakage and slippage might be slightly \\nhigher during anal intercourse (28,29). The failure of condoms \\nto protect against STIs or unintended pregnancy usually results \\nfrom inconsistent or incorrect use rather than condom breakage \\n(30). Users should check the expiration or manufacture date \\n\\non the box or individual package. Latex condoms should not \\nbe used beyond their expiration date or >5 years after the \\nmanufacturing date. Condoms made of materials other than \\nlatex are available in the United States and can be classified \\ninto two general categories: 1) polyurethane, polyisoprene, or \\nother synthetic condoms and 2) natural membrane condoms.\\n\\nPolyurethane external condoms provide protection against \\nSTIs and HIV and pregnancy comparable to that of latex \\ncondoms (20,31). These can be substituted for latex condoms \\nby persons with latex sensitivity, are typically more resistant to \\ndeterioration, and are compatible with use of both oil-based \\nand water-based lubricants. The effectiveness of other synthetic \\nexternal condoms to prevent STIs has not been extensively \\nstudied, and FDA labeling restricts their recommended use \\nto persons who are sensitive to or allergic to latex. Natural \\nmembrane condoms (frequently called natural skin condoms \\nor [incorrectly] lambskin condoms) are made from lamb cecum \\nand can have pores up to 1,500 nm in diameter. Although \\nthese pores do not allow the passage of sperm, they are more \\nthan 10 times the diameter of HIV and more than 25 times \\nthat of HBV. Moreover, laboratory studies demonstrate that \\nsexual transmission of viruses, including HBV, herpes simplex \\nvirus (HSV), and HIV, can occur with natural membrane \\ncondoms (31). Therefore, natural membrane condoms are not \\nrecommended for prevention of STIs and HIV.\\n\\nProviders should advise that condoms must be used \\nconsistently and correctly to be effective in preventing STIs and \\nHIV while noting that any condom use is better than no condom \\nuse. Providing instructions about the correct use of condoms \\ncan be useful. Communicating the following recommendations \\ncan help ensure that patients use external condoms correctly:\\n\\n• Use a new condom with each sex act (i.e., oral, vaginal, \\nand anal).\\n\\n• Carefully handle the condom to avoid damaging it with \\nfingernails, teeth, or other sharp objects.\\n\\n• Put the condom on after the penis is erect and before any \\ngenital, oral, or anal contact with the partner.\\n\\n• Use only water-based or silicone-based lubricants (e.g., \\nK-Y Jelly, Astroglide, AquaLube, or glycerin) with latex \\ncondoms. Oil-based lubricants (e.g., petroleum jelly, \\nshortening, mineral oil, massage oils, body lotions, or \\ncooking oil) can weaken latex and should not be used; \\nhowever, oil-based lubricants typically can be used with \\npolyurethane or other synthetic condoms.\\n\\n• Ensure adequate lubrication during vaginal and anal sex, \\nwhich might require using exogenous water-based \\nlubricants.\\n\\n• Hold the condom firmly against the base of the penis \\nduring withdrawal, and withdraw while the penis is still \\nerect to prevent the condom from slipping off.\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/index.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/index.html\\nhttp://www.ashasexualhealth.org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.pdf\\nhttp://www.ashasexualhealth.org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.pdf\\nhttp://www.ashasexualhealth.org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.pdf\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/index.html\\nhttp://www.factsaboutcondoms.com/professional.php\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n6 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nAdditional information about external condoms is available \\nat https://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness.\\n\\nInternal Condoms\\nCondoms for internal vaginal use, also known as female \\n\\ncondoms, are available worldwide (e.g., the FC2 Female \\nCondom, Reddy condom, Cupid female condom, and Woman’s \\ncondom) (31,32). Use of internal condoms can provide \\nprotection from acquisition and transmission of STIs, although \\ndata are limited. Internal condoms are more costly compared \\nwith external condoms; however, they offer the advantage of \\nbeing controlled by the receptive partner as an STI and HIV \\nprevention method, and the newer versions might be acceptable \\nto all persons. Although the internal condom also has been used \\nduring receptive anal intercourse, efficacy associated with this \\npractice remains unknown (33). Additional information about \\nthe internal condom is available at http://www.ashasexualhealth.\\norg/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.pdf.\\n\\nCervical Diaphragms\\nIn observational studies, diaphragm use has been \\n\\ndemonstrated to protect against cervical gonorrhea, chlamydia, \\nand trichomoniasis (34). However, a trial examining the effect \\nof a diaphragm plus lubricant on HIV acquisition among \\nwomen in Africa reported no additional protective effect when \\ncompared with the use of male condoms alone. Likewise, no \\ndifference by study arm in the rate of acquisition of chlamydia, \\ngonorrhea, or herpes occurred (35,36). Diaphragms should \\nnot be relied on as the sole source of protection against HIV \\nand other STIs.\\n\\nMultipurpose Prevention Technologies\\nMethods that combine STI and HIV prevention \\n\\nwith pregnancy prevention are known as multipurpose \\nprevention technologies (MPTs) (37) (https://www.who.int/\\nreproductivehealth/topics/linkages/mpts/en). Internal and \\nexternal condoms are both examples of MPTs because they are \\neffective prevention measures when used correctly for STI and \\nHIV transmission or pregnancy prevention. The multicenter \\nEvidence for Contraception Options and HIV Outcomes \\n(ECHO) trial observed no statistically significant differences in \\nHIV incidence rates among women randomly assigned to one \\nof three contraceptive methods (depot medroxyprogesterone \\nacetate [DMPA], levonorgestrel implant, and copper-\\ncontaining intrauterine device [IUD]); however, rates of HIV \\ninfection were high in all groups, indicating a need for MPTs \\n(38). Development of MPTs is complex and ongoing; products \\nunder study include microbicides with contraceptive devices \\n(e.g., tenofovir with a vaginal ring contraceptive delivery \\npackage) and other innovative methods (39).\\n\\nTopical Microbicides and Spermicides\\nNonspecific topical microbicides are ineffective for \\n\\npreventing HIV infection (40–45). Tenofovir gel has been \\nstudied for prevention of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) \\nand HIV infections (46,47). Adherence can be low (48), and \\nprevention of HIV infection, especially among women, has not \\nbeen demonstrated (47,49).Vaginal rings containing dapivirine \\nhave provided some reduction in HIV infection (50,51). For \\nmen and transgender women who have anal intercourse, \\ntenofovir gel appears safe when applied before and after anal \\nsex (52). Spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9) might \\ndisrupt genital or rectal epithelium and have been associated \\nwith an increased risk for HIV infection. Condoms with N-9 \\nare no more effective than condoms without N-9; therefore, \\nN-9 alone or in a condom is not recommended for STI and \\nHIV prevention (40). N-9 use also has been associated with \\nan increased risk for bacterial urinary tract infections among \\nwomen (53,54).\\n\\nNonbarrier Contraception, Female Surgical \\nSterilization, and Hysterectomy\\n\\nContraceptive methods that are not mechanical barriers \\noffer no protection against HIV or other STIs. The ECHO \\nstudy observed no differences in HIV incidence rates among \\nwomen randomly assigned to DMPA, levonorgestrel implant, \\nor copper-containing IUD contraceptive methods (38). A \\nsystematic review of epidemiologic evidence reported that the \\nmajority of studies demonstrated no association between use \\nof oral contraceptives and HIV acquisition among women \\n(55). Whether hormonal contraception alters a woman’s risk \\nfor other STIs is uncertain (56,57).\\n\\nSexually active women who use contraceptive methods \\nother than condoms should be counseled about STI and HIV \\ninfection prevention measures. These include pre-exposure \\nprophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), \\nlimiting the number of sex partners, and correct and consistent \\nuse of condoms.\\n\\nEmergency Contraception\\nUnprotected intercourse exposes women to risks for STIs \\n\\nand unplanned pregnancy. Providers should offer counseling \\nabout the option of emergency contraception if pregnancy \\nis not desired. Options for emergency contraception in the \\nUnited States include copper-containing IUDs and emergency \\ncontraceptive pills (ECPs) (58,59).

ECPs are most \\nefficacious when initiated as soon as possible after unprotected \\nsex. Ulipristal acetate is effective ≤5 days after unprotected sex, \\nand levonorgestrel is most effective ≤3 days after unprotected \\nsex but has some efficacy at ≤5 days.

An advance supply of ECPs can be provided or prescribed \\nso that ECPs will be available when needed (59).\\n\\nMale Circumcision\\nMale circumcision reduces the risk for HIV infection and \\n\\ncertain STIs among heterosexual men. Three randomized, \\ncontrolled trials performed in regions of sub-Saharan Africa, \\nwhere generalized HIV epidemics involving predominantly \\nheterosexual transmission were occurring, demonstrated that \\nmale circumcision reduces the risk for HIV acquisition among \\nmen by 50%–60% (63–65). In those trials, circumcision \\nalso was protective against other STIs, including high-risk \\ngenital HPV infection and genital herpes (66–68). Follow-up \\nstudies have demonstrated sustained benefit of circumcision \\nfor HIV prevention (69) and that the effect is not mediated \\nsolely through a reduction in HSV-2 infection or genital ulcer \\ndisease (GUD) (70).\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint \\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) \\nrecommend that male circumcision efforts be scaled up as an \\neffective intervention for preventing heterosexually acquired HIV \\ninfection (71) in countries with hyperendemic and generalized \\nHIV epidemics within the context of ensuring universal access \\nto comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support \\n\\n(https://www.afro.who.int/publications/voluntary-medical-male-\\ncircumcision-hiv-prevention). In the United States, the American \\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that newborn male \\ncircumcision be available to families that desire it because the \\nbenefits of the procedure, including prevention of penile cancers, \\nurinary tract infections, GUD, and HIV infection, outweigh the \\nrisks. ACOG has also endorsed AAP’s policy statement. In light \\nof these benefits, the American Urological Association states \\nthat male circumcision should be considered an option for risk \\nreduction, among other strategies (72). Additional information \\nfor providers counseling male patients and parents regarding \\nmale circumcision for preventing HIV, STIs, and other adverse \\nhealth outcomes is available at https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/\\nmale-circumcision.html.\\n\\nNo definitive data exist to determine whether male \\ncircumcision reduces HIV acquisition among MSM, although \\none meta-analysis of 62 observational studies reported that \\ncircumcision was protective against HIV acquisition in low- to \\nmiddle-income countries but not in high-income countries \\n(73). Further studies are needed to confirm any potential \\nbenefit of male circumcision for this population.\\n\\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV\\nDaily oral antiretroviral PrEP with a fixed-dose combination \\n\\nof emtricitabine (FTC) and either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \\n(TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) have demonstrated \\nsafety (74) and a substantial reduction in the rate of HIV \\nacquisition for MSM (75). TDF/FTC has demonstrated \\nsafety and efficacy for mixed-status heterosexual couples (76) \\nand heterosexual men and women recruited individually \\n(77); however, no evidence is yet available regarding TAF/\\nFTC among heterosexually active women. In addition, one \\nclinical trial involving persons who inject drugs (78) and one \\ninvolving heterosexual mixed-status couples (76) demonstrated \\nsubstantial efficacy and safety of daily oral PrEP with TDF \\nalone. High adherence to oral PrEP was strongly associated \\nwith protection from HIV infection. Studies conducted with \\nMSM have demonstrated that taking PrEP at specific times \\nbefore and after sexual intercourse was effective in preventing \\nHIV; however, less experience exits with this regimen, it is \\nnot FDA cleared, and it has not been studied among other \\npopulations (79).\\n\\nComprehensive clinical practice guidelines are available \\nfor providers in prescribing PrEP to reduce the risk for HIV \\ninfection (80). Among HIV-negative sexually active men \\nand women, bacterial STIs are key indicators of risk for \\nHIV acquisition.

Sexually \\nactive adults and adolescents should be screened for STIs \\n(e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) in accordance with \\nrecommendations, and persons with infection should be \\noffered PrEP. The USPSTF recommends that persons at risk \\nfor HIV acquisition be offered PrEP (84). Persons at risk for \\nHIV acquisition include HIV-negative persons whose sexual \\npartner or partners have HIV infection (especially if viral load \\nis detectable or unknown), persons who have had gonorrhea \\nor syphilis during the previous 6 months, and injecting drug \\nusers who share injection equipment (84). Clinical practice \\nguidelines recommend STI screening for persons taking PrEP \\n(80) because increased rates of STI acquisition have been \\ndescribed (85–87).\\n\\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for STIs\\nProviding HSV treatment to persons with HIV and HSV \\n\\ninfection has not demonstrated benefit in reducing HIV \\nacquisition among uninfected partners. A large randomized \\ncontrolled trial evaluated mixed-status heterosexual couples \\namong the partners with HIV infection who also were \\nseropositive for HSV-2 (88). Use of acyclovir had no effect \\non HIV transmission. These findings are consistent with a \\nprevious trial that reported no benefit of acyclovir in preventing \\nHIV acquisition among persons seropositive for HSV-2 (89).\\n\\nDoxycycline prophylaxis has been examined for preventing \\nbacterial STIs. In a pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with \\nprevious syphilis (two or more episodes since HIV diagnosis) \\nwere randomly assigned to doxycycline 100 mg for 48 weeks \\nversus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention (90). \\nThat study demonstrated a 73% reduction in any bacterial STI \\nat any site, without substantial differences in sexual behavior. \\nAdditional studies examining doxycycline prophylaxis are \\nunder way or in development (91).\\n\\nPostexposure Prophylaxis for HIV and STIs\\nGuidelines for using PEP aimed at preventing HIV and other \\n\\nSTIs as a result of sexual exposure are available at https://www.\\ncdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.\\npdf. Sexually active persons seeking HIV PEP should be \\nevaluated for PrEP after completing their PEP course and \\ntesting negative for HIV. HIV PEP is also discussed elsewhere \\nin this report (see Sexual Assault and Abuse and STIs). Genital \\nhygiene methods (e.g., vaginal washing and douching) after \\nsexual exposure are ineffective in protecting against HIV and \\nSTIs and might increase the risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV), \\ncertain STIs, and HIV infection (92).\\n\\nSTI PEP in the form of doxycycline 200 mg taken after \\nunprotected anal sex has been studied among MSM and \\ntransgender women; results demonstrated reduction in incident \\n\\nchlamydia and syphilis by 70% and 73%, respectively, but no \\neffect on gonorrhea (93). Other studies are under way or in \\ndevelopment regarding doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial \\nSTIs (91). No long-term data are available regarding the impact \\nof STI PEP on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome. \\nFurther studies are needed to determine whether STI PEP is \\nan effective and beneficial strategy for STI prevention.\\n\\nHIV Treatment as Prevention: Antiretroviral \\nTreatment of Persons with HIV to Prevent HIV \\nAmong Partners\\n\\nIn 2011, the randomized controlled trial HPTN 052 \\ndemonstrated that, among HIV mixed-status heterosexual \\ncouples, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the infected \\npartner decreased the risk for transmission to the uninfected \\npartner by 96% (94). Therefore, ART not only is beneficial to \\nthe health of persons with HIV infection, it also reduces the \\nrisk for transmission. Additional studies of HIV mixed-status \\ncouples, heterosexual and MSM couples (PARTNER study), \\nand MSM couples (Opposites Attract and PARTNERS2 \\nstudies) reported that patients with HIV taking ART who \\nmaintain an undetectable viral load demonstrate no risk for \\ntransmitting HIV to their HIV-negative sex partners (95–97). \\nFor those reasons, ART should be offered to all persons with \\nHIV infection to obtain viral suppression. Detailed guidance \\nregarding ART regimens is available in the U.S. Department of \\nHealth and Human Services’ HIV treatment guidelines (98).\\n\\nHIV Seroadaptive Strategies\\nSeroadaptive strategies for HIV prevention have largely \\n\\noriginated within communities of MSM. They are predicated \\non knowledge of self and partner HIV status. One specific \\nseroadaptive practice is serosorting, which includes limiting \\nanal sex without a condom to partners with the same HIV \\nstatus as their own or choosing to selectively use condoms \\nwith HIV mixed-status partners. Another practice among \\nmixed-status couples is seropositioning, in which the \\nperson with HIV infection is the receptive partner for anal \\nintercourse. Observational studies have consistently reported \\nthat serosorting confers greater risk for HIV infection than \\nconsistent condom use but has lower risk compared with anal \\nintercourse without a condom and without serosorting (99–\\n101). Serosorting practices have been associated with increased \\nrisk for STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea (102,103).\\n\\nSerosorting is not recommended for the following reasons: \\nmany MSM who have HIV infection do not know they \\nhave HIV because they have not been tested recently, men’s \\nassumptions about the HIV status of their partners might be \\nwrong, and some men with HIV infection might not disclose or \\nmight misrepresent their HIV status. All of these factors increase \\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.pdf\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.pdf\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 9US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nthe risk that serosorting can lead to HIV infection. Serosorting \\nhas not been studied among heterosexually active persons.\\n\\nAbstinence and Reduction of Number of \\nSex Partners\\n\\nAbstinence from oral, vaginal, and anal sex and participating \\nin a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with a \\npartner known to be uninfected are prevention approaches to \\navoid transmission of STIs. For persons who are being treated \\nfor an STI (or whose partners are undergoing treatment), \\ncounseling that encourages abstinence from sexual intercourse \\nuntil completion of the entire course of medication is vital \\nfor preventing reinfection. A trial conducted among women \\nregarding the effectiveness of counseling messages when \\npatients have cervicitis or vaginal discharge demonstrated \\nthat women whose sex partners have used condoms might \\nbenefit from a hierarchical message that includes condoms \\nbut women without such experience might benefit more from \\nan abstinence-only message (104). A more comprehensive \\ndiscussion of abstinence and other sexual practices that can help \\npersons reduce their risk for STIs is available in Contraceptive \\nTechnology, 21st Edition (31).\\n\\nPartner Services\\nThe term “partner services” refers to a continuum of clinical \\n\\nevaluation, counseling, diagnostic testing, and treatment \\ndesigned to increase the number of infected persons brought to \\ntreatment and to reduce transmission among sexual networks. \\nThis continuum includes efforts of health departments, \\nmedical providers, and patients themselves. The term “public \\nhealth partner services” refers to efforts by public health \\ndepartments to identify the sex and needle-sharing partners \\nof infected persons to ensure their medical evaluation and \\ntreatment. Health departments are increasingly incorporating \\nreferral to additional services, as indicated, into the partner services \\ncontinuum. Aside from the general benefit to patients and partners, \\nservice referrals and linkage can mitigate the circumstances that \\nincrease risk for future STI and HIV acquisition.\\n\\nThe types and comprehensiveness of public health partner \\nservices and the specific STIs for which they are offered vary \\nby public health agency, their resources, and the geographic \\nprevalence of STIs. In most areas of the United States, health \\ndepartments routinely attempt to provide partner services to \\nall persons with infectious syphilis (primary or secondary) \\nand persons with a new diagnosis of HIV infection. Health \\ndepartments should provide partner services for persons who \\nmight have cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea. In contrast, \\nrelatively few U.S. health departments routinely provide \\nSTI partner services to persons with gonorrhea, chlamydia, \\n\\ntrichomoniasis, or other STIs (105). Because STI diagnoses \\noften can serve as risk markers for HIV acquisition (83), public \\nhealth services might include follow-up of MSM with an STI \\nto offer HIV PrEP. Public health services can also include HIV \\nand STI prevention interventions including HIV and STI \\ntesting, linkage and relinkage of persons with HIV infection \\nto HIV care clinics, and referral of partners of persons with \\nSTIs or HIV infection to HIV PrEP, as indicated (106–109). \\nClinicians should familiarize themselves with public health \\npractices in their area; however, in most instances, providers \\nshould understand that responsibility for discussing the \\ntreatment of partners of persons with STIs rests with the \\ndiagnosing provider and the patient. State laws require a good \\nfaith effort by the provider to inform partners, and providers \\nshould familiarize themselves with public health laws.\\n\\nClinicians who do not notify partners of patients directly \\ncan still provide partner services by counseling infected persons \\nand providing them with written information and medication \\nto give to their partners (if recommended and allowable by \\nstate law), directly evaluating and treating sex partners, and \\ncooperating with state and local health departments. Clinicians’ \\nefforts to ensure treatment of patients’ sex partners can reduce \\nthe risk for reinfection and potentially diminish transmission \\nof STIs (110). Therefore, clinicians should encourage all \\npersons with STIs to notify their sex partners and urge them \\nto seek medical evaluation and treatment. Exceptions to this \\npractice include circumstances posing a risk for intimate \\npartner violence (111). Available data are limited regarding \\nthe rate of intimate partner violence directly attributable \\nto partner notification (112,113); however, because of the \\nreported prevalence of intimate partner violence in the general \\npopulation (114), providers should consider the potential \\nrisk before notifying partners of persons or encouraging \\npartner notification. Time spent counseling patients about the \\nimportance of notifying partners is associated with improved \\nnotification outcomes (115). When possible, clinicians should \\nadvise persons to bring their primary sex partner with them \\nwhen returning for treatment and should concurrently treat \\nboth persons. Although this approach can be effective for a \\nmain partner (116,117), it might not be a feasible approach \\nfor additional sex partners. Evidence indicates that providing \\npatients with written information to share with sex partners \\ncan increase rates of partner treatment (110).\\n\\nCertain health departments now use technology (e.g., \\nemail, texting, mobile applications, and social media outlets) \\nto facilitate partner services for locating and notifying the \\nsex partners of persons with STIs, including HIV (118,119). \\nPatients now have the option to use Internet sites to send \\nanonymous email or text messages advising partners of their \\nexposure to an STI (120); anonymous notification via the \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n10 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nInternet is considered better than no notification at all. \\nHowever, because the extent to which these sites affect partner \\nnotification and treatment is uncertain, patients should be \\nencouraged to notify their partners in person or by telephone, \\nemail, or text message; alternatively, patients can authorize a \\nmedical provider or public health professional to notify their \\nsex partners.\\n\\nExpedited Partner Therapy\\nExpedited partner therapy (EPT) is a harm-reduction \\n\\nstrategy and the clinical practice of treating the sex partners \\nof persons with diagnosed chlamydia or gonorrhea, who are \\nunable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, by providing \\nmedications or prescriptions to the patient as allowable by law. \\nPatients then provide partners with these therapies without \\nthe health care provider having examined the partner (https://\\nwww.cdc.gov/std/ept). Unless prohibited by law or other \\nregulations, medical providers should routinely offer EPT \\nto patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure \\nthat all of a patient’s sex partners from the previous 60 days \\nwill seek timely treatment. If the patient has not had sex \\nduring the 60 days before diagnosis, providers should offer \\nEPT for the patient’s most recent sex partner. Because EPT \\nmust be an oral regimen and current gonorrhea treatment \\ninvolves an injection, EPT for gonorrhea should be offered \\nto partners unlikely to access timely evaluation after linkage \\nis explored. EPT is legal in the majority of states but varies \\nby chlamydial or gonococcal infection. Providers should visit \\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/ept to obtain updated information for \\ntheir state. Providing patients with packaged oral medication \\nis the preferred approach because the efficacy of EPT using \\nprescriptions has not been evaluated, obstacles to EPT can exist \\nat the pharmacy level (121,122), and many persons (especially \\nadolescents) do not fill the prescriptions provided to them by \\na sex partner (123,124). Medication or prescriptions provided \\nfor EPT should be accompanied by educational materials for \\nthe partner, including treatment instructions, warnings about \\ntaking medications (e.g., if the partner is pregnant or has an \\nallergy to the medication), general health counseling, and a \\nstatement advising that partners seek medical evaluation as \\nsoon as possible for HIV infection and any symptoms of STIs, \\nparticularly PID.\\n\\nEvidence supporting EPT is based on three U.S. clinical \\ntrials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia \\nor gonorrhea (125–127). All three trials reported that more \\npartners were treated when patients were offered EPT. Two \\nreported statistically significant decreases in the rate of \\nreinfection, and one observed a lower risk for persistent or \\nrecurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant. A \\nfourth trial in the United Kingdom did not demonstrate a \\n\\ndifference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of \\npartners treated between persons offered EPT and those \\nadvised to notify their sex partners (128). U.S. trials and a \\nmeta-analysis of EPT revealed that the magnitude of reduction \\nin reinfection of index patients, compared with patient referral, \\ndiffered according to the STI and the sex of the index patient \\n(110,125–127). However, across trials, reductions in chlamydia \\nprevalence at follow-up were approximately 20%, and \\nreductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50% at follow-up.\\n\\nExisting data indicate that EPT also might have a role in \\npartner management for trichomoniasis; however, no partner \\nmanagement intervention has been reported to be more \\neffective than any other in reducing trichomoniasis reinfection \\nrates (129,130). No data support use of EPT in the routine \\nmanagement of patients with syphilis.\\n\\nData are limited regarding use of EPT for gonococcal \\nor chlamydial infections among MSM, compared with \\nheterosexuals (131,132). Published studies, including recent \\ndata regarding extragenital testing, indicated that male partners \\nof MSM with diagnosed gonorrhea or chlamydia might have \\nother bacterial STIs (gonorrhea or syphilis) or HIV (133–135). \\nStudies have reported that 5% of MSM have a new diagnosis \\nof HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal \\nor chlamydial infections (133,134); however, more recent data \\nindicate that, in certain settings, the frequency of HIV infection \\nis much lower (135). Considering limited data and potential \\nfor other bacterial STIs among MSM partners, shared clinical \\ndecision-making regarding EPT is recommended. All persons \\nwho receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, \\nparticularly MSM, should be tested for HIV, and those at risk \\nfor HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP (https://www.\\ncdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2017.pdf ).\\n\\nReporting and Confidentiality\\nAccurate and timely reporting of STIs is integral to public \\n\\nhealth efforts in assessing morbidity trends, allocating limited \\nresources, and assisting local health authorities with partner \\nnotification and treatment. STI and HIV/AIDS cases should \\nbe reported in accordance with state and local statutory \\nrequirements. Syphilis (including congenital syphilis), \\ngonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, and HIV are reportable \\ndiseases in every state. Because the requirements for reporting \\nother STIs differ by state, clinicians should be familiar with the \\nreporting requirements applicable within their jurisdictions.\\n\\nReporting can be provider based, laboratory based, or \\nboth. Clinicians who are unsure of state and local reporting \\nrequirements should seek advice from state or local health \\ndepartment STI programs. STI and HIV reports are kept \\nconfidential. In most jurisdictions, such reports are protected \\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/ept\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/ept\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/ept\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2017.pdf\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2017.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 11US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nby statute or regulation. Before conducting a follow-up \\nof a person with a positive STI test result, public health \\nprofessionals should consult the patient’s health care provider, \\nif possible, to inform them of the purpose of the public health \\nvisit, verify the diagnosis, determine the treatments received, \\nand ascertain the best approaches to patient follow-up.\\n\\nRetesting After Treatment to Detect \\nRepeat Infections\\n\\nRetesting 3 months after diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, \\nor trichomoniasis can detect repeat infection and potentially \\ncan be used to enhance population-based prevention (136,137). \\nAny person who has a positive test for chlamydia or gonorrhea, \\nalong with women who have a positive test for trichomonas, \\nshould be rescreened 3 months after treatment. Any person \\nwho receives a syphilis diagnosis should undergo follow-up \\nserologic syphilis testing per current recommendations \\nand follow-up testing for HIV (see Syphilis). Additional \\ninformation regarding retesting is available elsewhere in this \\nreport (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; \\nSyphilis; Trichomoniasis).\\n\\nSTI Detection Among Special \\nPopulations\\n\\nPregnant Women\\nIntrauterine or perinatally transmitted STIs can have \\n\\ndebilitating effects on pregnant women, their fetuses, and their \\npartners. All pregnant women and their sex partners should be \\nasked about STIs, counseled about the possibility of perinatal \\ninfections, and provided access to recommended screening and \\ntreatment, if needed.\\n\\nRecommendations for screening pregnant women for \\nSTIs to detect asymptomatic infections are based on disease \\nseverity and sequelae, prevalence among the population, costs, \\nmedicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. \\nThe following screening recommendations for pregnant \\nwomen summarize clinical guidelines from federal agencies \\nand medical professional organizations.\\n\\nScreening Recommendations\\n\\nHIV Infection\\n All pregnant women in the United States should be tested \\n\\nfor HIV at the first prenatal visit, even if they have been \\npreviously tested (138). Testing pregnant women for HIV \\nand prompt linkage to care of women with HIV infection are \\nvital for women’s health and reducing perinatal transmission of \\n\\nHIV through ART and obstetrical interventions. HIV testing \\nshould be offered as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests \\n(i.e., opt-out testing). For women who decline HIV testing, \\nproviders should address their concerns and, when appropriate, \\ncontinue to encourage testing. Partners of pregnant patients \\nshould be offered HIV testing if their status is unknown (139).\\n\\nRetesting in the third trimester (preferably before 36 weeks’ \\ngestation) is recommended for women at high risk for \\nacquiring HIV infection. Examples of women at high risk \\ninclude those who inject drugs, have STIs during pregnancy, \\nhave multiple sex partners during pregnancy, have a new \\nsex partner during pregnancy, or have partners with HIV \\ninfection; those who are receiving care in health care facilities \\nin settings with HIV incidence ≥1 per 1,000 women per year; \\nthose who are incarcerated; those who live in areas with high \\nrates of HIV infection; or those who have signs or symptoms \\nof acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, skin \\nrash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, oral ulcers, leukopenia, \\nthrombocytopenia, or transaminase elevation) (140).\\n\\nRapid HIV testing should be performed for any woman in labor \\nwho has not been tested for HIV during pregnancy or whose HIV \\nstatus is unknown, unless she declines. If a rapid HIV test result \\nis positive, ART should be administered without waiting for the \\nresults of confirmatory testing (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/\\ndefault/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf).\\n\\nSyphilis\\nDuring 2012–2019, congenital syphilis rates in the United \\n\\nStates increased from 8.4 to 48.5 cases per 100,000 births, \\na 477.4% increase (141). At least 45 states have a prenatal \\nsyphilis testing requirement, with high variability among those \\nrequirements (142). In the United States, all pregnant women \\nshould be screened for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, even \\nif they have been tested previously (143). Prenatal screening \\nfor syphilis has been reported to be suboptimal in the United \\nStates (144,145). Testing in the third trimester and at delivery \\ncan prevent congenital syphilis cases (146,147). Partners of \\npregnant women with syphilis should be evaluated, tested, \\nand treated.\\n\\nWhen access to prenatal care is not optimal, a stat rapid \\nplasma reagin (RPR) card test and treatment, if that test is \\nreactive, should be administered at the time that a pregnancy \\nis confirmed or when the pregnancy test is performed, if \\nfollow-up is uncertain. Pregnant women should be retested \\nfor syphilis at 28 weeks’ gestation and at delivery if the mother \\nlives in a community with high syphilis rates or is at risk for \\nsyphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs or \\nhas an STI during pregnancy, having multiple sex partners, \\nhaving a new sex partner, or having a sex partner with an STI). \\nNeonates should not be discharged from the hospital unless \\n\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n12 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nthe syphilis serologic status of the mother has been determined \\nat least once during pregnancy. Any woman who delivers a \\nstillborn infant should be tested for syphilis.\\n\\nHepatitis B\\nAll pregnant women should be routinely tested for hepatitis \\n\\nB surface antigen (HBsAg) at the first prenatal visit even if they \\nhave been previously vaccinated or tested (148). Women who \\nare HBsAg positive should be provided with, or referred for, \\ncounseling and medical management. Women who are HBsAg \\nnegative but at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. \\nWomen who were not screened prenatally, those who engage \\nin behaviors that put them at high risk for infection (e.g., \\nhaving had more than one sex partner during the previous \\n6 months, having been evaluated or treated for an STI, \\nhaving had recent or current injection drug use, or having an \\nHBsAg-positive sex partner), and those with clinical hepatitis \\nshould be tested at the time of admission to the hospital \\nfor delivery. To avoid misinterpreting a transient positive \\nHBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg \\ntesting should be performed before vaccine administration. \\nAll laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially \\nreactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory \\ntest. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time \\nof admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols can be \\nused, and initially reactive results should prompt expedited \\nadministration of immunoprophylaxis to neonates (148). \\nPregnant women who are HBsAg positive should be reported \\nto the local or state health department to ensure that they \\nare entered into a case-management system and that timely \\nand age-appropriate prophylaxis is provided to their infants. \\nInformation concerning the pregnant woman’s HBsAg status \\nshould be provided to the hospital where delivery is planned \\nand to the health care provider who will care for the newborn. \\nIn addition, household and sexual contacts of women who are \\nHBsAg positive should be vaccinated.\\n\\nChlamydia\\nAll pregnant women aged <25 years as well as older women \\n\\nat increased risk for chlamydia (e.g., those aged ≥25 years who \\nhave a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner \\nwith concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) \\nshould be routinely screened for Chlamydia trachomatis at the first \\nprenatal visit (149). Pregnant women who remain at increased \\nrisk for chlamydial infection also should be retested during the \\nthird trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and \\nchlamydial infection in the neonate. Pregnant women identified \\nas having chlamydia should be treated immediately and have a \\ntest of cure to document chlamydial eradication by a nucleic acid \\namplification test (NAAT) 4 weeks after treatment. All persons \\n\\ndiagnosed with a chlamydial infection should be rescreened \\n3 months after treatment.\\n\\nGonorrhea\\nAll pregnant women aged <25 years as well as women aged \\n\\n≥25 years at increased risk for gonorrhea (e.g., those with other \\nSTIs during pregnancy or those with a new sex partner, more \\nthan one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, \\nor a sex partner who has an STI or is exchanging sex for money \\nor drugs) should be screened for Neisseria gonorrhoeae at the \\nfirst prenatal visit (149). Pregnant women who remain at high \\nrisk for gonococcal infection also should be retested during the \\nthird trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and \\ngonococcal infection in the neonate. Clinicians should consider \\nthe communities they serve and might choose to consult local \\npublic health authorities for guidance on identifying groups \\nthat are more vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis \\nof local disease prevalence. Gonococcal infection, in particular, \\nis concentrated among specific geographic locations and \\ncommunities (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/default.\\nhtm). Pregnant women identified as having gonorrhea should \\nbe treated immediately. All persons diagnosed with gonorrhea \\nshould be rescreened 3 months after treatment.\\n\\nHepatitis C Virus\\nThe rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has increased \\n\\namong pregnant women in recent years (150–153). HCV \\nscreening should be performed for all pregnant women \\nduring each pregnancy, except in settings where the HCV \\ninfection (HCV positivity) rate is <0.1% (154–156). The most \\nimportant risk factor for HCV infection is past or current \\ninjecting drug use (157). Additional risk factors include having \\nhad a blood transfusion or organ transplantation before July \\n1992, having received clotting factor concentrates produced \\nbefore 1987, having received an unregulated tattoo, having \\nbeen on long-term hemodialysis, having other percutaneous \\nexposures, or having HIV infection. All women with HCV \\ninfection should receive counseling, supportive care, and \\nlinkage to care (https://www.hcvguidelines.org). No vaccine \\nis available for preventing HCV transmission.\\n\\nCervical Cancer\\nPregnant women should undergo cervical cancer screening \\n\\nand at the same frequency as nonpregnant women; however, \\nmanagement differs slightly during pregnancy (158). \\nColposcopy is recommended for the same indications during \\npregnancy as for nonpregnant women. However, biopsies \\nmay be deferred, and endocervical sampling should not \\nbe performed. Treatment should not be performed during \\npregnancy unless cancer is detected.\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/default.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/default.htm\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org/\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 13US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nBacterial Vaginosis, Trichomoniasis, and \\nGenital Herpes\\n\\nEvidence does not support routine screening for BV among \\nasymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm \\ndelivery (159). Symptomatic women should be evaluated \\nand treated (see Bacterial Vaginosis). Evidence does not \\nsupport routine screening for Trichomonas vaginalis among \\nasymptomatic pregnant women. Women who report symptoms \\nshould be evaluated and treated (see Trichomoniasis). In \\naddition, evidence does not support routine HSV-2 serologic \\nscreening among asymptomatic pregnant women. However, \\ntype-specific serologic tests might be useful for identifying \\npregnant women at risk for HSV-2 infection and for guiding \\ncounseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital herpes \\nduring pregnancy.

For \\nexample, reported rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea are highest \\namong females during their adolescent and young adult years, \\nand many persons acquire HPV infection during that time.\\n\\nPersons who initiate sex early in adolescence are at higher risk \\nfor STIs, as are adolescents living in detention facilities; those \\nreceiving services at STD clinics; those who are involved in \\ncommercial sex exploitation or survival sex and are exchanging \\nsex for drugs, money, food, or housing; young males who \\nhave sex with males (YMSM); transgender youths; and youths \\nwith disabilities, substance misuse, or mental health disorders. \\nFactors contributing to increased vulnerability to STIs during \\nadolescence include having multiple sex partners, having \\nsequential sex partnerships of limited duration or concurrent \\npartnerships, failing to use barrier protection consistently \\nand correctly, having lower socioeconomic status, and facing \\nmultiple obstacles to accessing health care (141,165).\\n\\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia explicitly allow \\nminors to consent for their own STI services. No state requires \\nparental consent for STI care, although the age at which a \\nminor can provide consent for specified health care services \\n(i.e., HPV vaccination and HIV testing and treatment) varies \\namong states. In 2019, a total of 18 states allowed but did not \\nrequire physicians to notify parents of a minor’s receipt of STI \\nservices, including states where minors can legally provide their \\nown consent to the service (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/\\nlaw/states/minors.html).\\n\\nProtecting confidentiality for STI care, particularly for \\nadolescents enrolled in private health insurance plans, presents \\nmultiple problems. After a claim has been submitted, many \\nstates mandate that health plans provide a written statement \\nto the beneficiary indicating the service performed, the charges \\ncovered, what the insurer allows, and the amount for which the \\npatient is responsible (i.e., explanation of benefits [EOB]) (166–\\n169). In addition, federal laws obligate notices to beneficiaries \\nwhen claims are denied, including alerting beneficiaries who \\nneed to pay for care until the allowable deductible is reached. \\nFor STI testing and treatment-related care, an EOB or \\nmedical bill that is received by a parent might disclose services \\nprovided and list STI laboratory tests performed or treatment \\nadministered. Some states have instituted mechanisms for \\nprotecting adolescents’ confidentiality and limiting EOBs. \\nAdditional risks to confidentiality breaches can inadvertently \\noccur through electronic health records, although technology \\ncontinues to evolve to assist with ensuring confidential care. \\nAAP and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine \\n(SAHM) have published guidance on strategies to address \\nemerging risks for confidentiality breaches associated with \\nhealth information technology (169).\\n\\nAAP and the SAHM recommend that providers have \\ntime alone with their adolescent patients that includes \\nassessment for sexual behavior.

Discussions concerning sexual behavior should be tailored \\nfor the patient’s developmental level and be aimed at identifying \\nrisk behaviors (e.g., multiple partners; oral, anal, or vaginal \\nsex; or drug misuse behaviors). Careful, nonjudgmental, and \\nthorough counseling is particularly vital for adolescents who \\nmight not feel comfortable acknowledging their engagement in \\nbehaviors that make them more vulnerable to acquiring STIs.\\n\\nScreening Recommendations\\nRecommendations for screening adolescents for STIs to \\n\\ndetect asymptomatic infections are based on disease severity \\nand sequelae, prevalence among the population, costs, \\nmedicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. \\nRoutine laboratory screening for common STIs is indicated \\nfor all sexually active adolescents. The following screening \\nrecommendations summarize published clinical prevention \\nguidelines for sexually active adolescents from federal agencies \\nand medical professional organizations.\\n\\nChlamydia\\nRoutine screening for C. trachomatis infection on an annual \\n\\nbasis is recommended for all sexually active females aged \\n<25 years (149). Rectal chlamydial testing can be considered \\nfor females on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and \\nexposure, through shared clinical decision-making between the \\npatient and the provider (170,171). Evidence is insufficient \\nto recommend routine screening for C. trachomatis among \\nsexually active young males, on the basis of efficacy and cost-\\neffectiveness. However, screening of sexually active young males \\nshould be considered in clinical settings serving populations \\nof young men with a high prevalence of chlamydial infections \\n(e.g., adolescent service clinics, correctional facilities, and STD \\nclinics). Chlamydia screening, including pharyngeal or rectal \\ntesting, should be offered to all YMSM at least annually on \\nthe basis of sexual behavior and anatomic site of exposure (see \\nMen Who Have Sex with Men).\\n\\nGonorrhea\\nRoutine screening for N. gonorrhoeae on an annual basis is \\n\\nrecommended for all sexually active females aged <25 years \\n(149). Extragenital gonorrhea screening (pharyngeal or rectal) \\ncan be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual \\nbehaviors and exposure, through shared clinical-decision \\nbetween the patient and the provider (170,171). Gonococcal \\ninfection is more prevalent among certain geographic \\nlocations and communities (141). Clinicians should consider \\nthe communities they serve and consult local public health \\n\\nauthorities for guidance regarding identifying groups that are \\nmore vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis of local \\ndisease prevalence. Evidence is insufficient to recommend \\nroutine screening, on the basis of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, \\nfor N. gonorrhoeae among asymptomatic sexually active young \\nmales who have sex with females only. Screening for gonorrhea, \\nincluding pharyngeal or rectal testing, should be offered to \\nYMSM at least annually (see Men Who Have Sex with Men).\\n\\nProviders might consider opt-out chlamydia and gonorrhea \\nscreening (i.e., the patient is notified that testing will be \\nperformed unless the patient declines, regardless of reported \\nsexual activity) for adolescent and young adult females during \\nclinical encounters. Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that \\nopt-out chlamydia screening among adolescent and young \\nadult females might substantially increase screening, be cost-\\nsaving (172), and identify infections among patients who do \\nnot disclose sexual behavior (173).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nHIV screening should be discussed and offered to all \\n\\nadolescents. Frequency of repeat screenings should be based on \\nthe patient’s sexual behaviors and the local disease prevelance \\n(138). Persons with HIV infection should receive prevention \\ncounseling and linkage to care before leaving the testing site.\\n\\nCervical Cancer\\nGuidelines from USPSTF and ACOG recommend that \\n\\ncervical cancer screening begin at age 21 years (174,175). This \\nrecommendation is based on the low incidence of cervical \\ncancer and limited usefulness of screening for cervical cancer \\namong adolescents (176). In contrast, the 2020 ACS guidelines \\nrecommend that cervical cancer screening begin at age 25 years \\nwith HPV testing. This change is recommended because the \\nincidence of invasive cervical cancer in women aged <25 years \\nis decreasing because of vaccination (177). Adolescents \\nwith HIV infection who have initiated sexual intercourse \\nshould have cervical screening cytology in accordance with \\nHIV/AIDS guidelines (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/\\nhuman-papillomavirus-disease?view=full).\\n\\nOther Sexually Transmitted Infections\\nYMSM and pregnant females should be routinely screened \\n\\nfor syphilis (see Pregnant Women; Men Who Have Sex with \\nMen). Local disease prevalence can help guide decision-\\nmaking regarding screening for T. vaginalis, especially among \\nadolescent females in certain areas. Routine screening of \\nadolescents and young adults who are asymptomatic for certain \\nSTIs (e.g., syphilis, trichomoniasis, BV, HSV, HAV, and HBV) \\nis not typically recommended. \\n\\nhttps://www.adolescenthealth.org/My-SAHM/Login-or-Create-an-Account.aspx?returnurl=%2fResources%2fClinical-Care-Resources%2fConfidentiality.aspx\\nhttps://www.adolescenthealth.org/My-SAHM/Login-or-Create-an-Account.aspx?returnurl=%2fResources%2fClinical-Care-Resources%2fConfidentiality.aspx\\nhttps://www.adolescenthealth.org/My-SAHM/Login-or-Create-an-Account.aspx?returnurl=%2fResources%2fClinical-Care-Resources%2fConfidentiality.aspx\\nhttps://www.adolescenthealth.org/My-SAHM/Login-or-Create-an-Account.aspx?returnurl=%2fResources%2fClinical-Care-Resources%2fConfidentiality.aspx\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/human-papillomavirus-disease?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/human-papillomavirus-disease?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/human-papillomavirus-disease?view=full\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 15US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nPrimary Prevention Recommendations\\nPrimary prevention and anticipatory guidance for recognizing \\n\\nsymptoms and behaviors associated with STIs are strategies that \\nshould be incorporated into all types of health care visits for \\nadolescents and young adults. The following recommendations \\nfor primary prevention of STIs (i.e., vaccination and \\ncounseling) are based on published clinical guidelines for \\nsexually active adolescents and young adults from federal \\nagencies and medical professional organizations.\\n\\n• HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years \\nfor those not vaccinated previously at the routine age of \\n11 or 12 years (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-\\nrecs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).\\n\\n• The HBV vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents \\nand young adults who have not previously received the universal \\nHBV vaccine series during childhood (12).\\n\\n• The HAV vaccination series should be offered to \\nadolescents and young adults as well as those who have \\nnot previously received the universal HAV vaccine series \\nduring childhood (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/\\nschedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html#note-hepa).\\n\\n• Information regarding HIV transmission, prevention, testing, \\nand implications of infection should be regarded as an essential \\ncomponent of the anticipatory guidance provided to all \\nadolescents and young adults as part of routine health care.\\n\\n• CDC and USPSTF recommend offering HIV PrEP to \\nadolescents weighing ≥35 kg and adults who are HIV \\nnegative and at substantial risk for HIV infection (80,178). \\nYMSM should be offered PrEP in youth-friendly settings \\nwith tailored adherence support (e.g., text messaging and \\nvisits per existing guidelines). Indications for PrEP, initial \\nand follow-up prescribing guidance, and laboratory testing \\nrecommendations are the same for adolescents and adults \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep).\\n\\n• Medical providers who care for adolescents and young \\nadults should integrate sexuality education into clinical \\npractice. Health care providers should counsel adolescents \\nabout the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for \\nacquiring STIs and should educate patients regarding \\nevidence-based prevention strategies, which includes a \\ndiscussion about abstinence and other risk-reduction \\nbehaviors (e.g., consistent and correct condom use and \\nreduction in the number of sex partners including \\nconcurrent partners). Interactive counseling approaches \\n(e.g., patient-centered counseling and motivational \\ninterviewing) are effective STI and HIV prevention \\nstrategies and are recommended by USPSTF. Educational \\nmaterials (e.g., handouts, pamphlets, and videos) can \\nreinforce office-based educational efforts.\\n\\nChildren\\nManagement of children who have STIs requires close \\n\\ncooperation among clinicians, laboratorians, and child-\\nprotection authorities. Official investigations, when indicated, \\nshould be initiated promptly. Certain diseases (e.g., gonorrhea, \\nsyphilis, HIV, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis), if acquired after \\nthe neonatal period, strongly indicate sexual contact. For other \\ndiseases (e.g., HSV, HPV and anogenital warts, and vaginitis), \\nthe association with sexual contact is not as clear (see Sexual \\nAssault and Abuse and STIs).\\n\\nMen Who Have Sex with Men\\nMSM comprise a diverse group in terms of behaviors, \\n\\nidentities, and health care needs (179). The term “MSM” often \\nis used clinically to refer to sexual behavior alone, regardless of \\nsexual orientation (e.g., a person might identify as heterosexual \\nbut still be classified as MSM). Sexual orientation is \\nindependent of gender identity. Classification of MSM can vary \\nin the inclusion of transgender men and women on the basis \\nof whether men are defined by sex at birth (i.e., transgender \\nwomen included) or current gender identity (i.e., transgender \\nmen included). Therefore, sexual orientation as well as gender \\nidentity of individual persons and their sex partners should be \\nobtained during health care visits. MSM might be at increased \\nrisk for HIV and other STIs because of their sexual network or \\nbehavioral or biologic factors, including number of concurrent \\npartners, condomless sex, anal sex, or substance use (180–182). \\nThese factors, along with sexual network or higher community \\ndisease prevalence, can increase the risk for STIs among MSM \\ncompared with other groups (183,184).\\n\\nPerforming a detailed and comprehensive sexual history is \\nthe first step in identifying vulnerability and providing tailored \\ncounseling and care (3). Factors associated with increased \\nvulnerability to STI acquisition among MSM include having \\nmultiple partners, anonymous partners, and concurrent \\npartners (185,186). Repeat syphilis infections are common and \\nmight be associated with HIV infection, substance use (e.g., \\nmethamphetamines), Black race, and multiple sex partners \\n(187). Similarly, gonorrhea incidence has increased among MSM \\nand might be more likely to display antimicrobial resistance \\ncompared with other groups (188,189). Gonococcal infection \\namong MSM has been associated with similar risk factors to \\nsyphilis, including having multiple anonymous partners and \\nsubstance use, especially methamphetamines (190). Disparities \\nin gonococcal infection are also more pronounced among certain \\nracial and ethnic groups of MSM (141).\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html#note-hepa\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html#note-hepa\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n16 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nHIV Risk Among Men Who Have Sex with Men\\nMSM are disproportionately at risk for HIV infection. In \\n\\nthe United States, the estimated lifetime risk for HIV infection \\namong MSM is one in six, compared with heterosexual men at \\none in 524 and heterosexual women at one in 253 (191). These \\ndisparities are further exacerbated by race and ethnicity, with \\nAfrican American/Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM having a \\none in two and a one in four lifetime risk for HIV infection, \\nrespectively. For HIV, transmission occurs much more readily \\nthrough receptive anal sex, compared with penile-vaginal sex \\n(192). Similar to other STIs, multiple partners, anonymous \\npartners, condomless sex, and substance use are all associated \\nwith HIV infection (193–196). Importantly, other STIs \\nalso might significantly increase the risk for HIV infection \\n(197–199). An estimated 10% of new HIV infections were \\nattributable to chlamydial or gonococcal infection (81). A \\nsubstantial number of MSM remain unaware of their HIV \\ndiagnosis (200). Clinical care involving MSM, including \\nthose who have HIV infection, should involve asking about \\nSTI-related risk factors and routine STI testing. Clinicians \\nshould routinely ask MSM about their sexual behaviors and \\nsymptoms consistent with common STIs, including urethral \\ndischarge, dysuria, ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, and \\nanorectal symptoms that might be consistent with proctitis \\n(e.g., discharge, rectal bleeding, pain on defecation, or pain \\nduring anal sex). However, certain STIs are asymptomatic, \\nespecially at rectal and pharyngeal sites, and routine testing \\nis recommended. In addition, clinicians should provide \\neducation and counseling regarding evidence-based safer-sex \\napproaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing \\nSTI incidence (see HIV Infection, Detection, Counseling, \\nand Referral).\\n\\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention\\nPrEP is the use of medications for preventing an infection \\n\\nbefore exposure. Studies have demonstrated that a daily oral \\nmedication TDF/FTC is effective in preventing HIV acquisition, \\nand specifically among MSM (74,75,201). PrEP guidelines \\nprovide information regarding sexually active persons who are at \\nsubstantial risk for acquiring HIV infection (having had anal or \\nvaginal sex during the previous 6 months with either a partner \\nwith HIV infection, a bacterial STI in the past 6 months, or \\ninconsistent or no condom use with a sex partner) or persons \\nwho inject drugs (injecting partner with HIV infection or sharing \\ninjection equipment) (80). Those guidelines provide information \\nregarding daily PrEP use for either TDF/FTC (men or women) \\nor tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine for MSM. Screening \\nfor bacterial STIs should occur at least every 6 months for all \\nsexually active patients and every 3 months among MSM or \\n\\namong patients with ongoing risk behaviors. MSM taking PrEP \\nmight compensate for decreased HIV acquisition risk by using \\ncondoms less frequently or modifying their behavior in other ways \\n(202,203), although data regarding this behavior are inconsistent. \\nStudies have reported that MSM taking PrEP have high rates of \\nSTIs, and frequent screening is warranted (204–206).\\n\\nImportance of Rectal and Pharyngeal Testing\\nRectal and pharyngeal testing by NAAT for gonorrhea \\n\\nand chlamydia is recognized as an important sexual health \\nconsideration for MSM. Rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia are \\nassociated with HIV infection (82,207), and men with repeat \\nrectal infections can be at substantially higher risk for HIV \\nacquisition (208). Pharyngeal infections with gonorrhea or \\nchlamydia might be a principal source of urethral infections \\n(209–211). Studies have demonstrated that among MSM, \\nprevalence of rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from \\n0.2% to 24% and 2.1% to 23%, respectively, and prevalence \\nof pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from 0.5% to \\n16.5% and 0% to 3.6%, respectively (171). Approximately \\n70% of gonococcal and chlamydial infections might be \\nmissed if urogenital-only testing is performed among MSM \\n(212–216) because most pharyngeal and rectal infections are \\nasymptomatic. Self-collected swabs have been reported to be \\nan acceptable means of collection for pharyngeal and rectal \\nspecimens (217–219), which can enhance patient comfort \\nand reduce clinical workloads.\\n\\nA detailed sexual history should be taken for all MSM to \\nidentify anatomic locations exposed to infection for screening. \\nClinics that provide services for MSM at high risk should \\nconsider implementing routine extragenital screening for \\nN. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections, and screening is \\nlikely to be cost-effective (220).\\n\\nScreening Recommendations\\nSTI screening among MSM has been reported to be \\n\\nsuboptimal. In a cross-sectional sample of MSM in the United \\nStates, approximately one third reported not having had an \\nSTI test during the previous 3 years, and MSM with multiple \\nsex partners reported less frequent screening (221). MSM \\nliving with HIV infection and engaged in care also experience \\nsuboptimal rates of STI testing (222,223). Limited data exist \\nregarding the optimal frequency of screening for gonorrhea, \\nchlamydia, and syphilis among MSM, with the majority of \\nevidence derived from mathematical modeling. Models from \\nAustralia have demonstrated that increasing syphilis screening \\nfrequency from two times a year to four times a year resulted \\nin a relative decrease of 84% from peak prevalence (224). In \\na compartmental model applied to different populations in \\nCanada, quarterly syphilis screening averted more than twice \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 17US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nthe number of syphilis cases, compared with semiannual \\nscreening (225). Furthermore, MSM screening coverage \\nneeded for eliminating syphilis among a population is \\nsubstantially reduced from 62% with annual screening to 23% \\nwith quarterly screening (226,227). In an MSM transmission \\nmodel that explored the impact of HIV PrEP use on STI \\nprevalence, quarterly chlamydia and gonorrhea screening was \\nassociated with an 83% reduction in incidence (205). The only \\nempiric data available that examined the impact of screening \\nfrequency come from an observational cohort of MSM using \\nHIV PrEP in which quarterly screening identified more \\nbacterial STIs, and semiannual screening would have resulted \\nin delayed treatment of 35% of total identified STI infections \\n(206). In addition, quarterly screening was reported to have \\nprevented STI exposure in a median of three sex partners \\nper STI infection (206). On the basis of available evidence, \\nquarterly screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis for \\ncertain sexually active MSM can improve case finding, which \\ncan reduce the duration of infection at the population level, \\nreduce ongoing transmission and, ultimately, prevalence among \\nthis population (228).\\n\\nPreventive screening for common STIs is indicated for all \\nMSM. The following screening recommendations summarize \\npublished federal agency and USPSTF clinical prevention \\nguidelines for MSM and should be performed at least annually.\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nHIV serologic testing is indicated if HIV status is unknown \\n\\nor if HIV negative and the patient or their sex partner has had \\nmore than one sex partner since the most recent HIV test.\\n\\nSyphilis\\nSyphilis serologic testing is indicated to establish whether \\n\\npersons with reactive tests have untreated syphilis, have partially \\ntreated syphilis, or are manifesting a slow or inadequate \\nserologic response to recommended previous therapy.\\n\\nGonorrhea and Chlamydia\\nThe following testing is recommended for MSM:\\n• A test for urethral infection* with N. gonorrhoeae and \\n\\nC. trachomatis among men who have had insertive \\nintercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT \\nis preferred).\\n\\n• A test for rectal infection* with N. gonorrhoeae and \\nC. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal \\nintercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT \\nis preferred).\\n\\n* Regardless of condom use during exposure.\\n\\n• A test for pharyngeal infection* with N. gonorrhoeae among \\nmen who have had receptive oral intercourse during the \\npreceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred).\\n\\n• Testing for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not \\nrecommended.\\n\\nBasing screening practices solely on history might be \\nsuboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable \\ntaking a detailed sexual history (229), men might also feel \\nuncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with \\ntheir provider, and rectal and pharyngeal infections can be \\nidentified even in the absence of reported risk behaviors (171). \\nFurthermore, the role of saliva, kissing, and rimming (i.e., \\noral-rectal contact) in the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and \\nC. trachomatis has not been well studied (230–232).\\n\\nRectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or self-\\ncollected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who \\nreport exposure at these sites. Testing can be offered to MSM \\nwho do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed \\nexplanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. \\nAll MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened \\nfor gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of \\nexposure as well as for syphilis.\\n\\nMore frequent STI screening (i.e., for syphilis, gonorrhea, \\nand chlamydia) at 3- to 6-month intervals is indicated for \\nMSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV \\ninfection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners \\nhave multiple partners. In addition, providers can consider \\nthe benefits of offering more frequent HIV screening (e.g., \\nevery 3–6 months) to MSM at increased risk for acquiring \\nHIV infection.\\n\\nHepatitis B Virus\\nAll MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core \\n\\nantibody, and HBV surface antibody testing to detect HBV \\ninfection (233). Vaccination against both HAV and HBV \\nis recommended for all MSM for whom previous infection \\nor vaccination cannot be documented. Serologic testing can \\nbe considered before vaccinating if the patient’s vaccination \\nhistory is unknown; however, vaccination should not be \\ndelayed. Vaccinating persons who have had previous infection \\nor vaccination does not increase the risk for vaccine-related \\nadverse events (see Hepatitis A Virus; Hepatitis B Virus).\\n\\nHepatitis C Virus\\nCDC recommends HCV screening at least once for all \\n\\nadults aged ≥18 years, except in settings where the prevalence \\nof HCV infection (HCV RNA positivity) is <0.1% (156). \\nThe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/\\nInfectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend \\nall MSM with HIV infection be screened for HCV during the \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n18 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ninitial HIV evaluation and at least annually thereafter (https://\\nwww.hcvguidelines.org). More frequent screening depends \\non ongoing risk behaviors, high-risk sexual behavior, and \\nconcomitant ulcerative STIs or STI-related proctitis. Sexual \\ntransmission of HCV can occur and is most common among \\nMSM with HIV infection (234–237). Screening for HCV in \\nthis setting is cost-effective (238,239). Screening should be \\nperformed by using HCV antibody assays followed by HCV \\nRNA testing for those with a positive antibody test. Suspicion \\nfor acute HCV infection (e.g., clinical evidence of hepatitis and \\nrisk behaviors) should prompt consideration for HCV RNA \\ntesting, despite a negative antibody test.\\n\\nHuman Papillomavirus\\nHPV infection and associated conditions (e.g., anogenital \\n\\nwarts and anal squamous intraepithelial lesions) are highly \\nprevalent among MSM. The HPV vaccination is recommended \\nfor all men, including MSM and transgender persons or \\nimmunocompromised males, including those with HIV \\ninfection, through age 26 years (11). More information is \\navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/downloads/9vhpv-\\nguidance.pdf.\\n\\nA digital anorectal examination (DARE) should be \\nperformed to detect early anal cancer among persons with HIV \\nand MSM without HIV but who have a history of receptive \\nanal intercourse. Data are insufficient to recommend routine \\nanal cancer screening with anal cytology in populations at risk \\nfor anal cancer (see Anal Cancer). Health centers that initiate a \\ncytology-based screening program should only do so if referrals \\nto high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and biopsy are available.\\n\\nHerpes Simplex Virus-2\\nEvaluation for HSV-2 infection with type-specific serologic \\n\\ntests also can be considered if infection status is unknown \\namong persons with previously undiagnosed genital tract \\ninfection (see Genital Herpes).\\n\\nPostexposure Prophylaxis and Pre-Exposure \\nProphylaxis for STI Prevention\\n\\nStudies have reported that a benefit might be derived \\nfrom STI PEP and PrEP for STI prevention. One study \\ndemonstrated that monthly oral administration of a 1-g dose \\nof azithromycin reduced infection with N. gonorrhoeae and \\nC. trachomatis but did not decrease the incidence of HIV \\ntransmission (240). Among MSM, doxycycline taken as PEP in \\na single oral dose ≤24 hours after sex decreased infection with \\nTreponema pallidum and C. trachomatis; however, no substantial \\neffect was observed for infection with N. gonorrhoeae (93). \\nDoxycycline taken as STI PrEP as 100 mg orally once daily \\nalso demonstrated a substantial reduction in gonorrhea, \\n\\nchlamydia, and syphilis among MSM (90). However, these \\nstudies had limitations because of small sample size, short \\nduration of therapy, and concerns about antibiotic resistance, \\nspecifically regarding N. gonorrhoeae (241). Further study is \\nneeded to determine the effectiveness of using antimicrobials \\nfor STI PrEP or PEP.\\n\\nCounseling and Education Approaches\\nDifferent counseling and STI prevention strategies are \\n\\nneeded to effectively engage different groups of MSM. \\nOutreach efforts should be guided by local surveillance efforts \\nand community input. Engaging MSM at risk through social \\nmedia, specifically online hookup sites, is an important \\noutreach effort to consider. Hookup sites are Internet sites \\nand mobile telephone applications that men might use for \\nmeeting other men for sex. Internet use might facilitate sexual \\nencounters and STI transmission among MSM, and many \\nmen report using hookup sites to meet partners (242–245). \\nThe ease and accessibility of meeting partners online might \\nreduce stigma and barriers of meeting partners through \\nother settings. Moreover, these sites offer an opportunity for \\neffective STI prevention messaging (246), although the cost \\nmight be limiting (247). Different groups of MSM might use \\ndifferent hookup sites, and efforts should be guided by local \\ncommunity input. Studies have demonstrated the acceptability \\nand feasibility of reaching MSM through these hookup sites \\nto promote STI prevention efforts (248,249).\\n\\nEnteric Infections Among Men Who Have Sex \\nwith Men\\n\\nThe importance of sexual transmission of enteric pathogens \\namong MSM has been recognized since the 1970s, after the \\nfirst report of MSM-associated shigellosis was reported in \\nSan Francisco (250,251). Global increases in the incidence \\nof shigellosis among adult MSM have been more recently \\nobserved (252–256). Sporadic outbreaks of Shigella sonnei \\nand Shigella flexneri have been reported among MSM \\n(257–262). Transmission occurs through oral-anal contact \\nor sexual contact, and transmission efficiency is enhanced by \\nboth biologic or host and behavioral factors. HIV without \\nviral suppression can be an independent risk factor that \\ncan contribute to transmission by increasing shedding of \\nthe enteric pathogen, increasing susceptibility of the host, \\nor both (255,263). Surveillance data in England during \\n2004–2015 demonstrated that 21% of nontravel-associated \\nShigella diagnoses among MSM were among persons with \\nHIV infection (255).\\n\\nOther enteric organisms might also cause disease among \\nMSM through sexual activities leading to oral-anal contact, \\nincluding bacteria such as Escherichia coli (264) and \\n\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hpv/downloads/9vhpv-guidance.pdf\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hpv/downloads/9vhpv-guidance.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 19US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nCampylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli (265,266); viruses \\nsuch as HAV (267); and parasites such as Giardia lamblia or \\nEntamoeba histolytica (268,269). Behavioral characteristics \\nassociated with the sexual transmission of enteric infections \\nare broadly similar to those associated with other STIs (e.g., \\ngonorrhea, syphilis, and lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV]). \\nThis includes multiple sex partners and online hookup sites \\nthat increase opportunities for sexual mixing, which might \\ncreate dense sexual networks that facilitate STI transmission \\namong MSM (270). Specific behaviors associated with sexually \\ntransmitted enteric infections among MSM involve attendance \\nat sex parties and recreational drug use including chem sex \\n(i.e., using crystal methamphetamine, gamma-butyrolactone, \\nor mephedrone before or during sex), which might facilitate \\ncondomless sex, group sex, fisting, use of sex toys, and scat play \\n(253,271). The growing number of sexually transmitted enteric \\ninfections might be attributable in part to the emergence of \\nantimicrobial resistance. This is well reported regarding Shigella \\nspecies, for which rapid intercontinental dissemination of a \\nS. flexneri 3a lineage with high-level resistance to azithromycin \\nthrough sexual transmission among MSM (272) and clusters \\nof multidrug resistant shigella cases among MSM have recently \\nbeen reported (273). Multidrug-resistant Campylobacter species \\nhave also been documented (266,274). For MSM patients with \\ndiarrhea, clinicians should request laboratory examinations, \\nincluding stool culture; provide counseling about the risk for \\ninfection with enteric pathogens during sexual activity (oral-\\nanal, oral-genital, anal-genital, and digital-anal contact) that \\ncould expose them to enteric pathogens; and choose treatment, \\nwhen needed, according to antimicrobial drug susceptibility.\\n\\nWomen Who Have Sex with Women and \\nWomen Who Have Sex with \\n\\nWomen and Men\\nWSW and WSWM comprise diverse groups with variations \\n\\nin sexual identity, practices, and risk behaviors. Studies \\nindicate that certain WSW, particularly adolescents, young \\nwomen, and WSWM, might be at increased risk for STIs \\nand HIV on the basis of reported risk behaviors (275–280). \\nStudies have highlighted the diversity of sexual practices and \\nexamined use of protective or risk-reduction strategies among \\nWSW populations (281–283). Use of barrier protection with \\nfemale partners (e.g., gloves during digital-genital sex, external \\ncondoms with sex toys, and latex or plastic barriers [also known \\nas dental dams for oral-genital sex]) was infrequent in all \\nstudies. Although health organizations have online materials \\ndirected to patients, few comprehensive and reliable resources \\nof sexual health information for WSW are available (284).\\n\\nRecent studies regarding STI rates among WSW and \\nWSWM indicate that WSWM experience higher rates of STIs \\nthan WSW, with rates comparable with women who have sex \\nwith men (WSM) in all studies reviewed (279,285,286). These \\nstudies indicate that WSW might experience STIs at lower \\nrates than WSWM and WSM, although still at significant \\nrates (287). One study reported higher sexual-risk behaviors \\namong adolescent WSWM and WSW than among adolescent \\nWSM (280). WSW report reduced knowledge of STI risks \\n(288), and both WSW and WSWM experience barriers to care, \\nespecially Black WSW and WSWM (289,290). In addition, a \\ncontinuum of sexual behaviors reported by WSW and WSWM \\nindicates the need for providers to not assume lower risk for \\nWSW, highlighting the importance of an open discussion \\nabout sexual health.\\n\\nFew data are available regarding the risk for STIs conferred \\nby sex between women; however, transmission risk probably \\nvaries by the specific STI and sexual practice (e.g., oral-genital \\nsex; vaginal or anal sex using hands, fingers, or penetrative \\nsex items; and oral-anal sex) (291,292). Practices involving \\ndigital-vaginal or digital-anal contact, particularly with shared \\npenetrative sex items, present a possible means for transmission \\nof infected cervicovaginal or anal secretions. This possibility \\nis most directly supported by reports of shared trichomonas \\ninfections (293,294) and by concordant drug-resistance \\ngenotype testing and phylogenetic linkage analysis identifying \\nHIV transmitted sexually between women (295,296). The \\nmajority of WSW (53%–97%) have had sex with men in the \\npast and continue to do so, with 5%–28% of WSW reporting \\nmale partners during the previous year (292,297–300).\\n\\nHPV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, \\nand sexual transmission of HPV likely occurs between WSW \\n(301–303). HPV DNA has been detected through polymerase \\nchain reaction (PCR)–based methods from the cervix, vagina, \\nand vulva among 13%–30% of WSW (301,302) and can \\npersist on fomites, including sex toys (304). Among WSW \\nwho report no lifetime history of sex with men, 26% had \\nantibodies to HPV-16, and 42% had antibodies to HPV-6 \\n(301). High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and \\nlow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) have been \\ndetected on Papanicolaou smears (Pap tests) among WSW \\nwho reported no previous sex with men (301,302). WSWM \\nare at risk for acquiring HPV from both their female partners \\nand male partners and thus are at risk for cervical cancer. \\nTherefore, routine cervical cancer screening should be offered \\nto all women, regardless of sexual orientation or practices, \\nand young adult WSW and WSWM should be offered HPV \\nvaccination in accordance with recommendations (11) (https://\\nwww.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n20 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nGenital transmission of HSV-2 between female sex partners \\nis inefficient but can occur. A U.S. population-based survey \\namong women aged 18–59 years demonstrated an HSV-2 \\nseroprevalence of 30% among women reporting same-sex \\npartners during the previous year, 36% among women \\nreporting same-sex partners in their lifetime, and 24% among \\nwomen reporting no lifetime same-sex behavior (299). HSV-2 \\nseroprevalence among women self-identifying as homosexual \\nor lesbian was 8%, similar to a previous clinic-based study of \\nWSW (299,305) but was 26% among Black WSW in one \\nstudy (287). The relatively frequent practice of orogenital sex \\namong WSW and WSWM might place them at higher risk \\nfor genital infection with HSV-1, a hypothesis supported by \\nthe recognized association between HSV-1 seropositivity and \\nprevious number of female partners. Thus, sexual transmission \\nof HSV-1 and HSV-2 can occur between female sex partners. \\nThis information should be communicated to women as part \\nof sexual health counseling.\\n\\nTrichomonas is a relatively common infection among WSW \\nand WSWM, with prevalence rates higher than for chlamydia \\nor gonorrhea (306,307), and direct transmission of trichomonas \\nbetween female partners has been demonstrated (293,294).\\n\\nLimited information is available regarding transmission \\nof bacterial STIs between female partners. Transmission of \\nsyphilis between female sex partners, probably through oral \\nsex, has been reported. Although the rate of transmission of \\nC. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae between women is unknown, \\ninfection also might be acquired from past or current male \\npartners. Data indicate that C. trachomatis infection among \\nWSW can occur (275,286,308,309). Data are limited \\nregarding gonorrhea rates among WSW and WSWM (170). \\nReports of same-sex behavior among women should not deter \\nproviders from offering and providing screening for STIs, \\nincluding chlamydia, according to guidelines.\\n\\nBV is common among women, and even more so among \\nwomen with female partners (310–312). Epidemiologic data \\nstrongly demonstrate that BV is sexually transmitted among \\nwomen with female partners. Evidence continues to support \\nthe association of such sexual behaviors as having a new partner, \\nhaving a partner with BV, having receptive oral sex, and having \\ndigital-vaginal and digital-anal sex with incident BV (313,314). \\nA study including monogamous couples demonstrated \\nthat female sex partners frequently share identical genital \\nLactobacillus strains (315). Within a community-based \\ncohort of WSW, extravaginal (i.e., oral and rectal) reservoirs \\nof BV-associated bacteria were a risk factor for incident BV \\n(316). Studies have examined the impact of specific sexual \\npractices on the vaginal microflora (306,317–319) and on \\nrecurrent (320) or incident (321,322) BV among WSW. A \\nBV pathogenesis study in WSW reported that Prevotella bivia, \\n\\nGardnerella vaginalis, and Atopobium vaginae might have \\nsubstantial roles in development of incident BV (323). These \\nstudies have continued to support, although have not proven, \\nthe hypothesis that sexual behaviors, specific BV-associated \\nbacteria, and possibly exchange of vaginal or extravaginal \\nmicrobiota (e.g., oral bacterial communities) between partners \\nmight be involved in the pathogenesis of BV among WSW.\\n\\nAlthough BV is common among WSW, routine screening \\nfor asymptomatic BV is not recommended. Results of one \\nrandomized trial used a behavioral intervention to reduce \\npersistent BV among WSW through reduced sharing of vaginal \\nfluid on hands or sex toys. Women randomly assigned to the \\nintervention were 50% less likely to report receptive digital-\\nvaginal contact without gloves than control subjects, and they \\nreported sharing sex toys infrequently. However, these women \\nhad no reduction in persistent BV at 1 month posttreatment \\nand no reduction in incident episodes of recurrent BV (324). \\nTrials have not been reported examining the benefits of treating \\nfemale partners of women with BV. Recurrent BV among \\nWSW is associated with having a same-sex partner and a lack of \\ncondom use (325). Increasing awareness of signs and symptoms \\nof BV among women and encouraging healthy sexual practices \\n(e.g., avoiding shared sex toys, cleaning shared sex toys, and \\nusing barriers) might benefit women and their partners.\\n\\nSexually active women are at risk for acquiring bacterial, \\nviral, and protozoal STIs from current and previous partners, \\nboth male and female. WSW should not be presumed to be at \\nlow or no risk for STIs on the basis of their sexual orientation. \\nReport of same-sex behavior among women should not deter \\nproviders from considering and performing screening for STIs \\nand cervical cancer according to guidelines. Effective screening \\nrequires that care providers and their female patients engage in \\na comprehensive and open discussion of sexual and behavioral \\nrisks that extends beyond sexual identity.\\n\\nTransgender and Gender Diverse Persons\\nTransgender persons often experience high rates of stigma and \\n\\nsocioeconomic and structural barriers to care that negatively \\naffect health care usage and increase susceptibility to HIV and \\nSTIs (326–332). Persons who are transgender have a gender \\nidentity that differs from the sex that they were assigned at birth \\n(333,334). Transgender women (also known as trans women, \\ntransfeminine persons, or women of transgender experience) \\nare women who were assigned male sex at birth (born with \\nmale anatomy). Transgender men (also known as trans men, \\ntransmasculine persons, or men of transgender experience) \\nare men who were assigned female sex at birth (i.e., born with \\nfemale anatomy). In addition, certain persons might identify \\noutside the gender binary of male or female or move back and \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 21US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nforth between different gender identities and use such terms \\nas “gender nonbinary,” “genderqueer,” or “gender fluid” to \\ndescribe themselves. Persons who use terms such as “agender” \\nor “null gender” do not identify with having any gender. The \\nterm “cisgender” is used to describe persons who identify with \\ntheir assigned sex at birth. Prevalence studies of transgender \\npersons among the overall population have been limited and \\noften are based on small convenience samples.\\n\\nGender identity is independent of sexual orientation. Sexual \\norientation identities among transgender persons are diverse. \\nPersons who are transgender or gender diverse might have sex \\nwith cisgender men, cisgender women, or other transgender \\nor gender nonbinary persons.\\n\\nClinical Environment Assessment\\nProviders should create welcoming environments that \\n\\nfacilitate disclosure of gender identity and sexual orientation. \\nClinics should document gender identity and sex assigned \\nat birth for all patients to improve sexual health care for \\ntransgender and gender nonbinary persons. Assessment of \\ngender identity and sex assigned at birth has been validated \\namong diverse populations, has been reported to be acceptable \\n(335,336), and might result in increased patients identifying \\nas transgender (337).\\n\\nLack of medical provider knowledge and other barriers to care \\n(e.g., discrimination in health care settings or denial of services) \\noften result in transgender and gender nonbinary persons \\navoiding or delaying preventive care services (338–340) and \\nincurring missed opportunities for HIV and STI prevention \\nservices. Gender-inclusive and trauma-guided health care \\nmight increase the number of transgender patients who seek \\nsexual health services, including STI testing (341), because \\ntransgender persons are at high risk for sexual violence (342).\\n\\nPrimary care providers should take a comprehensive sexual \\nhistory, including a discussion of STI screening, HIV PrEP \\nand PEP, behavioral health, and social determinants of sexual \\nhealth. Clinicians can improve the experience of sexual health \\nscreening and counseling for transgender persons by asking for \\ntheir choice of terminology or modifying language (e.g., asking \\npatients their gender pronouns) to be used during clinic visits \\nand history taking and examination (343). Options for fertility \\npreservation, pregnancy potential, and contraception options \\nshould also be discussed, if indicated. For transgender persons \\nwho retain a uterus and ovaries, ovulation might continue in \\nthe presence of testosterone therapy, and pregnancy potential \\nexists (https://transcare.ucsf.edu).\\n\\nTransgender Women\\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of HIV infection \\n\\namong transgender women estimated that HIV prevalence in \\n\\nthe United States is 14% among transgender women, with the \\nhighest prevalence among Black (44%) and Hispanic (26%) \\ntransgender women (344). Data also demonstrate high rates of \\nHIV infection among transgender women worldwide (345). \\nBacterial STI prevalence varies among transgender women and \\nis based largely on convenience samples. Despite limited data, \\ninternational and U.S. studies have indicated elevated incidence \\nand prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia among transgender \\nwomen similar to rates among cisgender MSM (346–348). A \\nrecent study using data from the STD Surveillance Network \\nrevealed that the proportions of transgender women with \\nextragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infections were similar \\nto those of cisgender MSM (349).\\n\\nProviders caring for transgender women should have \\nknowledge of their patients’ current anatomy and patterns \\nof sexual behavior before counseling them about STI and \\nHIV prevention. The majority of transgender women have \\nnot undergone genital-affirmation surgery and therefore \\nmight retain a functional penis; in these instances, they \\nmight engage in insertive oral, vaginal, or anal sex as well as \\nreceptive oral or anal sex. In the U.S. Transgender Survey, 12% \\nof transgender women had undergone vaginoplasty surgery, \\nand approximately 50% more were considering surgical \\nintervention (350). Providers should have knowledge about \\nthe type of tissue used to construct the neovagina, which \\ncan affect future STI and HIV preventive care and screening \\nrecommendations. The majority of vaginoplasty surgeries \\nconducted in the United States use penile and scrotal tissue \\nto create the neovagina (351). Other surgical techniques \\nuse intestinal tissue (e.g., sigmoid colon graft) or split-skin \\ngrafts (352). Although these surgeries involve penectomy and \\norchiectomy, the prostate remains intact. Transgender women \\nwho have had a vaginoplasty might engage in receptive vaginal, \\noral, or anal sex.\\n\\nNeovaginal STIs have infrequently been reported in \\nthe literature and include HSV and HPV/genital warts in \\npenile-inversion vaginoplasty, C. trachomatis in procedures \\nthat involved penile skin and grafts with urethra mucosa or \\nabdominal peritoneal lining (353), and N. gonorrhoeae in \\nboth penile-inversion and colovaginoplasty (354–359). If \\nthe vaginoplasty used an intestinal graft, a risk also exists for \\nbowel-related disease (e.g., adenocarcinoma, inflammatory \\nbowel disease, diversion colitis, and polyps) (360–362).\\n\\nTransgender Men\\nThe few studies of HIV prevalence among transgender men \\n\\nindicated that they have a lower prevalence of HIV infection \\nthan transgender women. A recent estimate of HIV prevalence \\namong transgender men was 2% (344). However, transgender \\nmen who have sex with cisgender men might be at elevated \\n\\nhttps://transcare.ucsf.edu/\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n22 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nrisk for HIV infection (332,363,364). Data are limited \\nregarding STI prevalence among transgender men, and the \\nmajority of studies have used clinic-based data or convenience \\nsampling. Recent data from the STD Surveillance Network \\ndemonstrated higher prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia \\namong transgender men, similar to rates reported among \\ncisgender MSM (365).\\n\\nThe U.S. Transgender Survey indicated that the proportion \\nof transgender men and gender diverse persons assigned \\nfemale sex at birth who have undergone gender-affirmation \\ngenital surgery is low. Providers should consider the anatomic \\ndiversity among transgender men because a person can undergo \\na metoidioplasty (a procedure to increase the length of the \\nclitoris), with or without urethral lengthening, and might not \\nhave a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and therefore be at risk \\nfor bacterial STIs, HPV, HSV, HIV, and cervical cancer (366). \\nFor transgender men using gender-affirming hormone therapy, \\nthe decrease in estradiol levels caused by exogenous testosterone \\ncan lead to vaginal atrophy (367,368) and is associated with a \\nhigh prevalence of unsatisfactory sample acquisition (369). The \\nimpact of these hormonal changes on mucosal susceptibility \\nto HIV and STIs is unknown.\\n\\nTransgender men who have not chosen to undergo \\nhysterectomy with removal of the cervix remain at risk for \\ncervical cancer. These persons often avoid cervical cancer \\nscreening because of multiple factors, including discomfort \\nwith medical examinations and fear of discrimination \\n(338,370). Providers should be aware that conducting a \\nspeculum examination can be technically difficult after \\nmetoidioplasty surgery because of narrowing of the introitus. \\nIn these situations, high-risk HPV testing using a swab can \\nbe considered; self-collected swabs for high-risk HPV testing \\nhas been reported to be an acceptable option for transgender \\nmen (371).\\n\\nScreening Recommendations\\nThe following are screening recommendations for \\n\\ntransgender and gender diverse persons:\\n• Because of the diversity of transgender persons regarding \\n\\nsurgical gender-affirming procedures, hormone use, and \\ntheir patterns of sexual behavior, providers should remain \\naware of symptoms consistent with common STIs and \\nscreen for asymptomatic infections on the basis of the \\npatient’s sexual practices and anatomy.\\n\\n• Gender-based screening recommendations should be \\nadapted on the basis of anatomy (e.g., routine screening \\nfor C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae) as recommended \\nfor all sexually active females aged <25 years on an annual \\nbasis and should be extended to transgender men and \\nnonbinary persons with a cervix among this age group.\\n\\n• HIV screening should be discussed and offered to all \\ntransgender persons. Frequency of repeat screenings should \\nbe based on level of risk.\\n\\n• For transgender persons with HIV infection who have sex \\nwith cisgender men and transgender women, STI \\nscreening should be conducted at least annually, including \\nsyphilis serology, HCV testing, and urogenital and \\nextragenital NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia.\\n\\n• Transgender women who have had vaginoplasty surgery \\nshould undergo routine STI screening for all exposed sites \\n(e.g., oral, anal, or vaginal). No data are available regarding \\nthe optimal screening method (urine or vaginal swab) for \\nbacterial STIs of the neovagina. The usual techniques for \\ncreating a neovagina do not result in a cervix; therefore, \\nno rationale exists for cervical cancer screening (368).\\n\\n• If transgender men have undergone metoidioplasty surgery \\nwith urethral lengthening and have not had a vaginectomy, \\nassessment of genital bacterial STIs should include a \\ncervical swab because a urine specimen will be inadequate \\nfor detecting cervical infections.\\n\\n• Cervical cancer screening for transgender men and \\nnonbinary persons with a cervix should follow current \\nscreening guidelines (see Human Papillomavirus Infections).\\n\\nPersons in Correctional Facilities\\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that persons entering \\n\\ncorrectional facilities have a high prevalence of STIs, HIV, and \\nviral hepatitis, especially those aged ≤35 years (141,372,373). \\nRisk behaviors for acquiring STIs (e.g., having condomless \\nsex, having multiple sex partners, substance misuse, and \\nengaging in commercial, survival, or coerced sex) are common \\namong incarcerated populations. Before their incarceration, \\nmany persons have had limited access to medical care. Other \\nsocial determinants of health (e.g., insufficient social and \\neconomic support or living in communities with high local \\nSTI prevalence) are common. Addressing STIs in correctional \\nsettings is vital for addressing the overall STI impact among \\naffected populations.\\n\\nGrowing evidence demonstrates the usefulness of expanded \\nSTI screening and treatment services in correctional settings, \\nincluding short-term facilities (jails), long-term institutions \\n(prisons), and juvenile detention centers. For example, in \\njurisdictions with comprehensive, targeted jail screening, more \\nchlamydial infections among females (and males if screened) \\nare detected and subsequently treated in the correctional setting \\nthan in any other single reporting source (141,374) and might \\nrepresent the majority of reported cases in certain jurisdictions \\n(375). Screening in the jail setting has the potential to reach \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 23US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nsubstantially more persons at risk than screening among the \\nprison population alone.\\n\\nBoth males and females aged ≤35 years in juvenile and adult \\ndetention facilities have been reported to have higher rates of \\nchlamydia and gonorrhea than nonincarcerated persons in \\nthe community (141,374,376). Syphilis seroprevalence rates, \\nwhich can indicate previously treated or current infection, are \\nconsiderably higher among incarcerated adult men and women \\nthan among adolescents, which is consistent with the overall \\nnational syphilis trends (141,374). Detection and treatment \\nof early syphilis in correctional facilities might affect rates \\nof transmission among adults and prevention of congenital \\nsyphilis (377).\\n\\nIn jails, approximately half of entrants are released back \\ninto the community within 48 hours. As a result, treatment \\ncompletion rates for those screened for STIs and who receive \\nSTI diagnoses in short-term facilities might not be optimal. \\nHowever, because of the mobility of incarcerated populations \\nin and out of the community, the impact of screening in \\ncorrectional facilities on the prevalence of infections among \\ndetainees and subsequent transmission in the community \\nafter release might be considerable (378). Moreover, treatment \\ncompletion rates of ≥95% in short-term facilities can be \\nachieved by offering screening at or shortly after intake, \\nthus facilitating earlier receipt of test results and, if needed, \\nfollow-up of untreated persons can be conducted through \\npublic health outreach.\\n\\nUniversal, opt-out screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea \\namong females aged ≤35 years entering juvenile and adult \\ncorrectional facilities is recommended (379). Males aged \\n<30 years entering juvenile and adult correctional facilities \\nshould also be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea (380). \\nOpt-out screening has the potential to substantially increase \\nthe number tested and the number of chlamydia and gonorrhea \\ninfections detected (381–385). Point-of-care (POC) NAAT \\nmight also be considered if the tests have demonstrated \\nsufficient sensitivity and specificity. Studies have demonstrated \\nhigh prevalence of trichomoniasis among incarcerated \\nfemales (386–392).\\n\\nScreening Recommendations\\n\\nChlamydia and Gonorrhea\\nFemales aged ≤35 years and males aged <30 years housed \\n\\nin correctional facilities should be screened for chlamydia and \\ngonorrhea. This screening should be conducted at intake and \\noffered as opt-out screening.\\n\\nTrichomonas\\nFemales aged ≤35 years housed in correctional facilities \\n\\nshould be screened for trichomonas. This screening should be \\nconducted at intake and offered as opt-out screening.\\n\\nSyphilis\\nOpt-out screening for incarcerated persons should be \\n\\nconducted on the basis of the local area and institutional \\nprevalence of early (primary, secondary, or early latent) \\ninfectious syphilis. Correctional facilities should stay apprised \\nof local syphilis prevalence. In short-term facilities, screening \\nat entry might be indicated.\\n\\nViral Hepatitis\\nAll persons housed in juvenile and adult correctional facilities \\n\\nshould be screened at entry for viral hepatitis, including HAV, \\nHBV, and HCV, depending on local prevalence and the \\nperson’s vaccination status. Vaccination for HAV and HBV \\nshould be offered if the person is susceptible.\\n\\nCervical Cancer\\nWomen and transgender men who are housed in correctional \\n\\nfacilities should be screened for cervical cancer as for women \\nwho are not incarcerated (393,394) (see Cervical Cancer).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nAll persons being housed in juvenile and adult correctional \\n\\nfacilities should be screened at entry for HIV infection; \\nscreening should be offered as opt-out screening. For those \\nidentified as being at risk for HIV infection (e.g., with \\ndiagnosed gonorrhea or syphilis or persons who inject drugs) \\nand being released into the community, starting HIV PrEP \\n(or providing linkage to a community clinic for HIV PrEP) \\nfor HIV prevention should be considered (395,396). Persons \\nare likely to engage in high-risk activities immediately after \\nrelease from incarceration (397). For those identified with \\nHIV infection, treatment should be initiated. Those persons \\nreceiving PrEP or HIV treatment should have linkage to \\ncare established before release. Correctional settings should \\nconsider implementing other STI prevention approaches, \\nboth during incarceration and upon release, which might \\ninclude educational and behavioral counseling interventions \\n(398–401), vaccination (e.g., for HPV) (402,403), condom \\ndistribution (404,405), EPT (125), and PrEP to prevent HIV \\ninfection (see Primary Prevention Methods).\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n24 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nDetection, Counseling, and Referral\\n\\nInfection with HIV causes an acute but brief and nonspecific \\ninfluenza-like retroviral syndrome that can include fever, \\nmalaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, arthritis, or skin \\nrash. Most persons experience at least one symptom; however, \\nsome might be asymptomatic or have no recognition of illness \\n(406–409). Acute infection transitions to a multiyear, chronic \\nillness that progressively depletes CD4+ T lymphocytes crucial \\nfor maintenance of effective immune function. Ultimately, \\npersons with untreated HIV infection experience symptomatic, \\nlife-threatening immunodeficiency (i.e., AIDS).\\n\\nEffective ART that suppresses HIV replication to undetectable \\nlevels reduces morbidity, provides a near-normal lifespan, and \\nprevents sexual transmission of HIV to others (95–97,410–\\n412). Early diagnosis of HIV and rapid linkage to care are \\nessential for achieving these goals. Guidelines from both the \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the \\nInternational AIDS Society–USA Panel recommend that all \\npersons with HIV infection be offered effective ART as soon \\nas possible, both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to \\nprevent HIV transmission (413).\\n\\nSTD specialty or sexual health clinics are a vital partner in \\nreducing HIV infections in the United States. These clinics \\nprovide safety net services to vulnerable populations in need \\nof HIV prevention services who are not served by the health \\ncare system and HIV partner service organizations. Diagnosis \\nof an STI is a biomarker for HIV acquisition, especially among \\npersons with primary or secondary syphilis or, among MSM, \\nrectal gonorrhea or chlamydia (197). STD clinics perform only \\napproximately 20% of all federally funded HIV tests nationally \\nbut identify approximately 30% of all new infections (414). \\nAmong testing venues, STD clinics are high performing in \\nterms of linkage to HIV care within 90 days of diagnosis; \\nduring 2013–2017, the percentage of persons with a new \\ndiagnosis in an STD clinic and linked to care within 90 days \\nincreased from 55% to >90% (415,415).\\n\\nScreening Recommendations\\nThe following recommendations apply to testing for HIV:\\n• HIV testing is recommended for all persons seeking STI \\n\\nevaluation who are not already known to have HIV infection. \\nTesting should be routine at the time of the STI evaluation, \\nregardless of whether the patient reports any specific behavioral \\nrisks for HIV. Testing for HIV should be performed at the time \\nof STI diagnosis and treatment if not performed at the initial \\nSTI evaluation and screening (82,195,416).\\n\\n• CDC and USPSTF recommend HIV screening at least \\nonce for all persons aged 15–65 years (417).\\n\\n• Persons at higher risk for HIV acquisition, including \\nsexually active gay, bisexual, and other MSM, should be \\nscreened for HIV at least annually. Providers can consider \\nthe benefits of offering more frequent screening (e.g., every \\n3–6 months) among MSM at increased risk for acquiring \\nHIV (418,419).\\n\\n• All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the \\nfirst prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, \\npreferably at <36 weeks’ gestation, should be considered \\nand is recommended for women who are at high risk for \\nacquiring HIV infection, women who receive health care \\nin jurisdictions with high rates of HIV, and women \\nexamined in clinical settings in which HIV incidence  is \\n≥1 per 1,000 women screened per year (138,140). \\n\\n• HIV screening should be voluntary and free from coercion. \\nPatients should not be tested without their knowledge.\\n\\n• Opt-out HIV screening (notifying the patient that an HIV \\ntest will be performed, unless the patient declines) is \\nrecommended in all health care settings. CDC also \\nrecommends that consent for HIV screening be \\nincorporated into the general informed consent for \\nmedical care in the same manner as other screening or \\ndiagnostic tests.\\n\\n• Requirement of specific signed consent for HIV testing is \\nnot recommended. General informed consent for medical \\ncare is considered sufficient to encompass informed \\nconsent for HIV testing.\\n\\n• Providers should use a laboratory-based antigen/antibody \\n(Ag/Ab) combination assay as the first test for HIV, unless \\npersons are unlikely to follow up with a provider to receive \\ntheir HIV test results; in those cases screening with a rapid \\nPOC test can be useful.\\n\\n• Preliminary positive screening tests for HIV should be \\nfollowed by supplemental testing to establish the diagnosis.\\n\\n• Providing prevention counseling as part of HIV screening \\nprograms or in conjunction with HIV diagnostic testing is \\nnot required (6). However, persons might be more likely to \\nthink about HIV and consider their risk-related behavior \\nwhen undergoing an HIV test. HIV testing gives providers \\nan opportunity to conduct STI and HIV prevention \\ncounseling and communicate risk-reduction messages.\\n\\n• Acute HIV infection can occur among persons who report \\nrecent sexual or needle-sharing behavior or who have had \\nan STI diagnosis.\\n\\n• Providers should test for HIV RNA if initial testing according \\nto the HIV testing algorithm recommended by CDC is \\nnegative or indeterminate when concerned about acute HIV \\ninfection (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872).\\n\\nhttps://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 25US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n• Providers should not assume that a laboratory report of a \\nnegative HIV Ag/Ab or antibody test indicates that the requisite \\nHIV RNA testing for acute HIV infection has been conducted. \\nThey should consider explicitly requesting HIV RNA testing \\nwhen concerned about early acute HIV infection.\\n\\n• Providers should assess eligibility of all persons seeking \\nSTI services for HIV PrEP and PEP. For persons with \\nsubstantial risk whose results are HIV negative, providers \\nshould offer or provide referral for PrEP services, unless \\nthe last potential HIV exposure occurred <72 hours, in \\nwhich case PEP might be indicated.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nHIV infection can be diagnosed by HIV 1/2 Ag/Ab \\n\\ncombination immunoassays. All FDA-cleared HIV tests are \\nhighly sensitive and specific. Available serologic tests can \\ndetect all known subtypes of HIV-1. The majority also detect \\nHIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1 (e.g., group O and \\ngroup N).\\n\\nAccording to an algorithm for HIV diagnosis, CDC \\nrecommends that HIV testing begin with a laboratory-\\nbased HIV-1/HIV-2 Ag/Ab combination assay, which, if \\nrepeatedly reactive, is followed by a laboratory-based assay \\nwith a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation \\nassay (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872). This algorithm \\nconfers an additional advantage because it can detect HIV-2 \\nantibodies after the initial immunoassay. Although HIV-2 is \\nuncommon in the United States, accurate identification is \\nvital because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from \\nthat for HIV-1 (420). RNA testing should be performed \\non all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative \\nsupplemental antibody test results to determine whether the \\ndiscordance represents acute HIV infection.\\n\\nRapid POC HIV tests can enable clinicians to make a \\npreliminary diagnosis of HIV infection in <20 minutes. The \\nmajority of rapid antibody assays become reactive later in the \\ncourse of HIV infection than conventional laboratory-based \\nassays and thus can produce negative results among persons \\nrecently infected (e.g., acutely infected persons). Furthermore, \\nHIV home-test kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore \\nwill not detect acute HIV infection. If early or acute infection \\nis suspected and a rapid HIV antibody assay is negative, \\nconfirmatory testing with combined laboratory-based assays or \\nRNA testing should be performed. CDC recommends that all \\npersons with reactive rapid tests be assessed with a laboratory-\\nbased Ag/Ab assay. Additional details about interpretation of \\nresults by using the HIV testing algorithm recommended by \\nCDC are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/48472.\\n\\nAcute HIV Infection\\nProviders serving persons at risk for STIs are in a position \\n\\nto diagnose HIV infection during its acute phase. Diagnosing \\nHIV infection during the acute phase is particularly important \\nbecause persons with acute HIV have highly infectious \\ndisease due to the concentration of virus in plasma and \\ngenital secretions, which is extremely elevated during that \\nstage of infection (421,422) (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-\\nhiv-infection?view=full). ART during acute HIV infection \\nis recommended because it substantially reduces infection \\ntransmission to others, improves laboratory markers of \\ndisease, might decrease severity of acute disease, lowers viral \\nsetpoint, reduces the size of the viral reservoir, decreases \\nthe rate of viral mutation by suppressing replication, and \\npreserves immune function (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-\\nhiv-infection?view=full). Persons who receive an acute HIV \\ndiagnosis should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical \\ncare provider, provided prevention counseling (e.g., advised to \\nreduce the number of partners and to use condoms correctly \\nand consistently), and screened for STIs. Information should be \\nprovided regarding availability of PEP for sexual and injecting \\ndrug use partners not known to have HIV infection if the \\nmost recent contact was <72 hours preceding HIV diagnosis.\\n\\nWhen providers test by using the CDC algorithm, specimens \\ncollected during acute infection might give indeterminate or \\nnegative results because insufficient anti-HIV antibodies and \\npotentially insufficient antigen are present to be reactive on \\nAg/Ab combination assays and supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 \\nantibody differentiation assays. Whenever acute HIV infection \\nis suspected (e.g., initial testing according to the CDC algorithm \\nis negative or indeterminate after a possible sexual exposure to \\nHIV within the previous few days to weeks, especially if the \\nperson has symptoms or has primary or secondary syphilis, \\ngonorrhea, or chlamydia), additional testing for HIV RNA \\nis recommended. If this additional testing for HIV RNA is \\nalso negative, repeat testing in a few weeks is recommended \\nto rule out very early acute infection when HIV RNA might \\nnot be detectable. A more detailed discussion of testing in \\nthe context of acute HIV infection is available at https://\\nclinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/\\ninitiation-antiretroviral-therapy?view=full.\\n\\nTreatment\\nART should be initiated as soon as possible for all persons with \\n\\nHIV infection regardless of CD4+ T-cell count, both for individual \\nhealth and to prevent HIV transmission (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.\\ngov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf). \\n\\nhttps://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872\\nhttps://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/48472\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/initiation-antiretroviral-therapy?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/initiation-antiretroviral-therapy?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/initiation-antiretroviral-therapy?view=full\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n26 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nPersons with HIV infection who achieve and maintain a viral load \\nsuppressed to <200 copies/mL with ART have effectively no risk \\nfor sexually transmitting HIV (95–97,421). Early HIV diagnosis \\nand treatment is thus not only vital for individual health but also as \\na public health intervention to prevent new infections. Knowledge \\nof the prevention benefit of treatment can help reduce stigma and \\nincrease the person’s commitment to start and remain adherent \\nto ART (423). The importance of adherence should be stressed \\nas well as the fact that ART does not protect against other STIs \\nthat can be prevented by using condoms. Interventions to assist \\npersons to remain adherent to their prescribed HIV treatment, to \\notherwise reduce the possibility of transmission to others, and to \\nprotect themselves against STIs, have been developed for diverse \\npopulations at risk (424) (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/\\nfiles/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).\\n\\nComprehensive HIV treatment and care services might not \\nbe available in facilities focused primarily on STI treatment. \\nProviders in such settings should be knowledgeable about HIV \\ntreatment and care options available in their communities \\nand promptly link persons who have newly diagnosed HIV \\ninfection and any persons with HIV infection who are not \\nengaged in ongoing effective care to a health care provider \\nor facility experienced in caring for persons living with HIV \\n(https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/\\nAdultandAdolescentGL.pdf ).\\n\\nOther HIV Management Considerations\\nBehavioral and psychosocial services are integral to caring for \\n\\npersons with HIV infection. Providers should expect persons \\nto be distressed when first informed that they have HIV. They \\nface multiple adaptive challenges, including coping with the \\nreactions of others to a stigmatizing illness, developing and \\nadopting strategies to maintain physical and emotional health, \\ninitiating changes in behavior to prevent HIV transmission to \\nothers, and reducing the risk for acquiring additional STIs. \\nMany persons will require assistance gaining access to health \\ncare and other support services and coping with changes in \\npersonal relationships.\\n\\nPersons with HIV infection might have additional needs \\n(e.g., referral for substance use or mental health disorders). \\nOthers require assistance to secure and maintain employment \\nand housing. Persons capable of reproduction might require \\nfamily planning counseling, information about reproductive \\nhealth choices, and referral for reproductive health care.\\n\\nThe following recommendations apply to managing persons \\nwith diagnosed HIV infection:\\n\\n• Link persons with HIV infection to care and start them \\non ART as soon as possible.\\n\\n• Report cases (in accordance with local requirements) to \\npublic health and initiate partner services.\\n\\n• Provide prevention counseling to persons with diagnosed \\nHIV infection.\\n\\n• Ensure all persons with HIV infection are informed that \\nif they achieve and maintain a suppressed viral load, they \\nhave effectively no risk for transmitting HIV. Stress that \\na suppressed viral load is not a substitute for condoms and \\nbehavioral modifications because ART does not protect \\npersons with HIV against other STIs.\\n\\n• Provide additional counseling, either on-site or through \\nreferral, about the psychosocial and medical implications \\nof having HIV infection.\\n\\n• Assess the need for immediate medical care and \\npsychosocial support.\\n\\n• Link persons with diagnosed HIV infection to services \\nprovided by health care personnel experienced in managing \\nHIV infection. Additional services that might be needed \\ninclude substance misuse counseling and treatment, \\ntreatment for mental health disorders or emotional distress, \\nreproductive counseling, risk-reduction counseling, and \\ncase management. Providers should follow up to ensure \\nthat patients have received services for any identified needs.\\n\\n• Persons with HIV infection should be educated about the \\nimportance of ongoing medical care and what to expect \\nfrom these services.\\n\\nSTI Screening of Persons with HIV Infection in HIV \\nCare Settings\\n\\nAt the initial HIV care visit, providers should screen all \\nsexually active persons for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, \\nand perform screening for these infections at least annually \\nduring the course of HIV care (425). Specific testing \\nincludes syphilis serology and NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae and \\nC. trachomatis at the anatomic site of exposure. Women should \\nalso be screened for trichomoniasis at the initial visit and \\nannually thereafter. Women should be screened for cervical \\ncancer precursor lesions per existing guidelines (98).\\n\\nMore frequent screening for syphilis, gonorrhea, and \\nchlamydia (e.g., every 3 or 6 months) should be tailored \\nto individual risk and the local prevalence of specific STIs. \\nCertain STIs can be asymptomatic; their diagnosis might \\nprompt referral for partner services, might identify sexual and \\nneedle-sharing partners who can benefit from early diagnosis \\nand treatment of HIV, and might prompt reengagement in \\ncare or HIV prevention services (e.g., PEP or PrEP) (8). More \\ndetailed information on screening, testing, and treatment is \\nprovided in pathogen-specific sections of this report.\\n\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 27US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nPartner Services and Reporting\\nPartner notification is a key component in the evaluation \\n\\nof persons with HIV infection. Early diagnosis and treatment \\nof HIV among all potentially exposed sexual and injecting \\ndrug sharing partners can improve their health and reduce \\nnew infections. For those partners without HIV infection, \\npartner services also provide an opportunity for offering HIV \\nprevention services, including PrEP or PEP (if exposure was \\n<72 hours previous) and STI testing and treatment.\\n\\nHealth care providers should inform persons with diagnosed \\nHIV infection about any legal obligations of providers to report \\ncases of HIV to public health; the local confidential processes \\nfor managing partner services, including that a public health \\ndepartment still might be in contact to follow up in their care \\nand partner services; and the benefits and risks of partner \\nnotification and services. Health care providers should also \\nencourage persons with a new HIV diagnosis to notify their \\npartners and provide them with referral information for their \\npartners about HIV testing. Partner notification for exposure \\nto HIV should be confidential. Health care providers can assist \\nin the partner notification process, either directly or by referral \\nto health department partner notification programs. Health \\ndepartment staff are trained to use public health investigation \\nstrategies for confidentially locating persons who can benefit \\nfrom HIV treatment, care, or prevention services. Guidance \\nregarding spousal notification varies by jurisdiction. Detailed \\nrecommendations for notification, evaluation, and treatment of \\nexposed partners are available in Recommendations for Partner \\nServices Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and \\nChlamydial Infections (111).\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nAll pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the \\n\\nfirst prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, \\npreferably at <36 weeks’ gestation, should be considered and \\nis recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring \\nHIV, women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high \\nrates of HIV infection, and women served in clinical settings \\nin which prenatal screening identifies ≥1 pregnant woman \\nwith HIV per 1,000 women screened (138). Diagnostic \\nalgorithms for HIV for pregnant women do not differ from \\nthose for nonpregnant women (see STI Detection Among \\nSpecial Populations). Pregnant women should be informed \\nthat HIV testing will be performed as part of the routine panel \\nof prenatal tests (138); for women who decline HIV testing, \\nproviders should address concerns that pose obstacles, discuss \\nthe benefits of testing (e.g., early HIV detection, treatment, and \\ncare for improving health of the mother and reducing perinatal \\n\\ntransmission of HIV), and encourage testing at subsequent \\nprenatal visits. Women who decline testing because they have \\nhad a previous negative HIV test result should be informed \\nabout the importance of retesting during each pregnancy. \\nWomen with no prenatal care should be tested for HIV at the \\ntime of delivery.\\n\\nTesting pregnant women is crucial because knowledge of \\ninfection status can help maintain the woman’s health, and \\nit enables receipt of interventions (i.e., ART or specialized \\nobstetrical care) that can substantially reduce the risk for \\nperinatal transmission of HIV. Pregnant women with \\ndiagnosed HIV infection should be educated about the benefits \\nof ART for their own health and for reducing the risk for HIV \\ntransmission to their infant. In the absence of ART, a mother’s \\nrisk for transmitting HIV to her neonate is approximately \\n30%; however, risk can be reduced to <2% through ART, \\nobstetrical interventions (i.e., elective cesarean delivery at \\n38 weeks’ pregnancy), and breastfeeding avoidance (https://\\nclinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.\\npdf ). Pregnant women with HIV infection should be linked \\nto an HIV care provider experienced in managing HIV in \\npregnancy and provided antenatal and postpartum treatment \\nand advice. Detailed and regularly updated recommendations \\nfor managing pregnant patients with HIV infection are \\navailable at https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-\\nfiles/PerinatalGL.pdf.\\n\\nHIV Infection Among Neonates, Infants, and Children\\nDiagnosis of HIV infection in a pregnant woman indicates \\n\\nthe need for evaluating and managing the HIV-exposed \\nneonate and considering whether the woman’s other children, \\nif any, might be infected. Detailed recommendations regarding \\ndiagnosis and management of HIV infection among neonates \\nand children of mothers with HIV are beyond the scope of \\nthese guidelines but are available at https://clinicalinfo.hiv.\\ngov/en/guidelines. Exposed neonates and children with HIV \\ninfection should be referred to physicians with expertise in \\nneonatal and pediatric HIV management.\\n\\nDiseases Characterized by Genital, \\nAnal, or Perianal Ulcers\\n\\nIn the United States, the majority of young, sexually active \\npatients who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers have either \\ngenital herpes or syphilis. The frequency of each condition \\ndiffers by geographic area and population; however, genital \\nherpes is the most prevalent of these diseases. More than one \\netiologic agent (e.g., herpes and syphilis) can be present in \\nany genital, anal, or perianal ulcer. Less common infectious \\n\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf\\nhttps://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n28 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ncauses of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers include chancroid, \\nLGV, and granuloma inguinale (donovanosis). GUDs (e.g., \\nsyphilis, herpes, and LGV) might also present as oral ulcers. \\nGenital herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and chancroid \\nhave been associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition \\nand transmission. Genital, anal, or perianal lesions can also be \\nassociated with infectious and noninfectious conditions that \\nare not sexually transmitted (e.g., yeast, trauma, carcinoma, \\naphthae or Behcet’s disease, fixed drug eruption, or psoriasis).\\n\\nA diagnosis based only on medical history and physical \\nexamination frequently can be inaccurate. Therefore, all \\npersons who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be \\nevaluated. Specific evaluation of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers \\nincludes syphilis serology tests and darkfield examination \\nfrom lesion exudate or tissue, or NAAT if available; NAAT \\nor culture for genital herpes type 1 or 2; and serologic testing \\nfor type-specific HSV antibody. In settings where chancroid is \\nprevalent, a NAAT or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi should \\nbe performed.\\n\\nNo FDA-cleared NAAT for diagnosing syphilis is available \\nin the United States; however, multiple FDA-cleared NAATs \\nare available for diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 in genital \\nspecimens. Certain clinical laboratories have developed their \\nown syphilis and HSV NAATs and have conducted Clinical \\nLaboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) verification \\nstudies with genital specimens. Type-specific serology for \\nHSV-2 might aid in identifying persons with genital herpes \\n(see Genital Herpes). In addition, biopsy of ulcers with \\nimmunohistochemistry can help identify the cause of ulcers \\nthat are unusual or that do not respond to initial therapy. HIV \\ntesting should be performed on all persons not known to have \\nHIV infection who present with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers \\n(see Diagnostic Considerations in disease-specific sections). \\nNAAT testing at extragenital sites should be considered for \\ncases in which GUDs are suspected (e.g., oral manifestations \\nof syphilis, herpes, or LGV). Commercially available NAATs \\nhave not been cleared by FDA for these indications; however, \\nthey can be used by laboratories that have met regulatory \\nrequirements for an off-label procedure.\\n\\nBecause early syphilis treatment decreases transmission \\npossibility, public health standards require health care \\nproviders to presumptively treat any patient with a suspected \\ncase of infectious syphilis at the initial visit, even before test \\nresults are available. Presumptive treatment of a patient with a \\nsuspected first episode of genital herpes also is recommended \\nbecause HSV treatment benefits depend on prompt therapy \\ninitiation. The clinician should choose the presumptive \\ntreatment on the basis of the clinical presentation (i.e., HSV \\nlesions begin as vesicles and primary syphilis as a papule) and \\nepidemiologic circumstances (e.g., high incidence of disease \\n\\namong populations and communities and travel history). For \\nexample, syphilis is so common among MSM that any male \\nwho has sex with men presenting with a genital ulcer should be \\npresumptively treated for syphilis at the initial visit after syphilis \\nand HSV tests are performed. After a complete diagnostic \\nevaluation, >25% of patients who have genital ulcers might \\nnot have a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (426).\\n\\nChancroid\\nChancroid prevalence has declined in the United States \\n\\n(141). When infection does occur, it is usually associated \\nwith sporadic outbreaks. Worldwide, chancroid appears to \\nhave decreased as well, although infection might still occur in \\ncertain Africa regions and the Caribbean. Chancroid is a risk \\nfactor in HIV transmission and acquisition (197).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nA definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires identifying \\n\\nH. ducreyi on special culture media that is not widely \\navailable from commercial sources; even when these media \\nare used, sensitivity is <80% (427). No FDA-cleared NAAT \\nfor H. ducreyi is available in the United States; however, \\nsuch testing can be performed by clinical laboratories that \\nhave developed their own NAAT and have conducted CLIA \\nverification studies on genital specimens.\\n\\nThe combination of one or more deep and painful \\ngenital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy \\nindicates the chancroid diagnosis; inguinal lymphadenitis \\ntypically occurs in <50% of cases (428). For both clinical and \\nsurveillance purposes, a probable diagnosis of chancroid can \\nbe made if all of the following four criteria are met: 1) the \\npatient has one or more painful genital ulcers; 2) the clinical \\npresentation, appearance of genital ulcers and, if present, \\nregional lymphadenopathy are typical for chancroid; 3) the \\npatient has no evidence of T. pallidum infection by darkfield \\nexamination or NAAT (i.e., ulcer exudate or serous fluid) or \\nby serologic tests for syphilis performed at least 7–14 days \\nafter onset of ulcers; and 4) HSV-1 or HSV-2 NAAT or HSV \\nculture performed on the ulcer exudate or fluid are negative.\\n\\nTreatment\\nSuccessful antimicrobial treatment for chancroid cures \\n\\nthe infection, resolves the clinical symptoms, and prevents \\ntransmission to others. In advanced cases, genital scarring and \\nrectal or urogenital fistulas from suppurative buboes can result \\ndespite successful therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 29US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Chancroid\\n\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose\\nor\\n\\nCeftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose\\nor\\n\\nCiprofloxacin 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days\\nor\\n\\nErythromycin base 500 mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days\\n\\nAzithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the advantage of \\nsingle-dose therapy (429). Worldwide, several isolates with \\nintermediate resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin \\nhave been reported. However, because cultures are not routinely \\nperformed, and chancroid is uncommon, data are limited \\nregarding prevalence of H. ducreyi antimicrobial resistance.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nMen who are uncircumcised and persons with HIV infection \\n\\ndo not respond as well to treatment as persons who are \\ncircumcised or are HIV negative (430). Patients should be \\ntested for HIV at the time chancroid is diagnosed. If the initial \\nHIV test results were negative, the provider can consider the \\nbenefits of offering more frequent testing and HIV PrEP to \\npersons at increased risk for HIV infection.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nPatients should be reexamined 3–7 days after therapy \\n\\ninitiation. If treatment is successful, ulcers usually improve \\nsymptomatically within 3 days and objectively within 7 days \\nafter therapy. If no clinical improvement is evident, the clinician \\nshould consider whether the diagnosis is correct, another STI \\nis present, the patient has HIV infection, the treatment was \\nnot used as instructed, or the H. ducreyi strain causing the \\ninfection is resistant to the prescribed antimicrobial. The time \\nrequired for complete healing depends on the size of the ulcer; \\nlarge ulcers might require >2 weeks. In addition, healing can \\nbe slower for uncircumcised men who have ulcers under the \\nforeskin. Clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is \\nslower than that of ulcers and might require needle aspiration \\nor incision and drainage, despite otherwise successful therapy. \\nAlthough needle aspiration of buboes is a simpler procedure, \\nincision and drainage might be preferred because of reduced \\nneed for subsequent drainage procedures.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nRegardless of whether disease symptoms are present, sex \\n\\npartners of patients with chancroid should be examined and \\ntreated if they had sexual contact with the patient during the \\n10 days preceding the patient’s symptom onset.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nData indicate ciprofloxacin presents a low risk to the \\n\\nfetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during \\nbreastfeeding (431). Alternative drugs should be used if the \\npatient is pregnant or lactating. No adverse effects of chancroid \\non pregnancy outcome have been reported.\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with HIV infection who have chancroid infection \\n\\nshould be monitored closely because they are more likely to \\nexperience chancroid treatment failure and to have ulcers \\nthat heal slowly (430,432). Persons with HIV might require \\nrepeated or longer courses of therapy, and treatment failures \\ncan occur with any regimen. Data are limited concerning \\nthe therapeutic efficacy of the recommended single-dose \\nazithromycin and ceftriaxone regimens among persons with \\nHIV infection.\\n\\nChildren\\nBecause sexual contact is the major primary transmission route \\n\\namong U.S. patients, diagnosis of chancroid ulcers among infants \\nand children, especially in the genital or perineal region, is highly \\nsuspicious of sexual abuse. However, H. ducreyi is recognized as a \\nmajor cause of nonsexually transmitted cutaneous ulcers among \\nchildren in tropical regions and, specifically, countries where \\nyaws is endemic (433–435). Acquisition of a lower-extremity \\nulcer attributable to H. ducreyi in a child without genital ulcers \\nand reported travel to a region where yaws is endemic should \\nnot be considered evidence of sexual abuse.\\n\\nGenital Herpes \\nGenital herpes is a chronic, lifelong viral infection. Two types \\n\\nof HSV can cause genital herpes: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Most \\ncases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2, and \\n11.9% of persons aged 14–49 years are estimated to be infected \\nin the United States (436). However, an increasing proportion \\nof anogenital herpetic infections have been attributed to \\nHSV-1, which is especially prominent among young women \\nand MSM (186,437,438).\\n\\nThe majority of persons infected with HSV-2 have not \\nhad the condition diagnosed, many of whom have mild or \\nunrecognized infections but shed virus intermittently in the \\nanogenital area. Consequently, most genital herpes infections \\nare transmitted by persons unaware that they have the \\ninfection or who are asymptomatic when transmission occurs. \\nManagement of genital HSV should address the chronic nature \\nof the infection rather than focusing solely on treating acute \\nepisodes of genital lesions.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n30 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nClinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the \\n\\nself-limited, recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions \\nclassically associated with HSV are absent in many infected persons \\nat the time of clinical evaluation. If genital lesions are present, \\nclinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-\\nspecific virologic testing from the lesion by NAAT or culture (186). \\nRecurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for \\nHSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes \\n(439,440). Therefore, prognosis and counseling depend on which \\nHSV type is present. Type-specific serologic tests can be used to \\naid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the absence of genital \\nlesions. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific serologic tests \\nfor HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide care \\nto persons with or at risk for STIs. HSV-2 genital herpes infection \\nincreases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, \\nall persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV (441).\\n\\nVirologic Tests\\nHSV NAAT assays are the most sensitive tests because \\n\\nthey detect HSV from genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous \\nlesions; these tests are increasingly available (442–444). \\nAlthough multiple FDA-cleared assays exist for HSV detection, \\nthese tests vary in sensitivity from 90.9% to 100%; however, \\nthey are considered highly specific (445–447). PCR is also \\nthe test of choice for diagnosing HSV infections affecting the \\ncentral nervous system (CNS) and systemic infections (e.g., \\nmeningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes). HSV PCR \\nof the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital \\nherpes infection, except in cases in which concern exists for \\ndisseminated infection (e.g., hepatitis). In certain settings, viral \\nculture is the only available virologic test. The sensitivity of viral \\nculture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and decreases \\nrapidly as lesions begin to heal (443,448). Viral culture \\nisolates and PCR amplicons should be typed to determine \\nwhether HSV-1 or HSV-2 is causing the infection. Failure to \\ndetect HSV by NAAT or culture, especially in the presence \\nof older lesions or the absence of active lesions, does not \\nindicate an absence of HSV infection because viral shedding \\nis intermittent. Similarly, random or blind genital swabs in \\nthe absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital \\nHSV infection because sensitivity is low, and a negative result \\ndoes not exclude the presence of HSV infection.\\n\\nCytologic detection of cellular changes associated with HSV \\ninfection is an insensitive and nonspecific method of diagnosing \\ngenital lesions (i.e., Tzanck preparation) and therefore should \\nnot be relied on. Although a direct immunofluorescence \\nassay using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies is also \\navailable for detecting HSV antigen from genital specimens, \\nthis assay lacks sensitivity and is not recommended (449).\\n\\nType-Specific Serologic Tests\\nBoth type-specific and type-common antibodies to HSV \\n\\ndevelop during the first weeks after infection and persist \\nindefinitely. The majority of available, accurate type-\\nspecific HSV serologic assays are based on the HSV-specific \\nglycoprotein G2 (gG2) (HSV-2) and glycoprotein G1 (gG1) \\n(HSV-1). Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish \\nbetween HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific \\nserologic assays should be requested (450–452).\\n\\nBoth laboratory-based assays and POC tests that provide \\nresults for HSV-2 antibodies from capillary blood or serum \\nduring a clinic visit are available. The sensitivity of glycoprotein \\nG type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from \\n80% to 98%; false-negative results might be more frequent \\nat early stages of infection (451,453,454). Therefore, in \\ncases of recent suspected HSV-2 acquisition, repeat type-\\nspecific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time \\nof acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, \\nHerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), often is \\nfalsely positive at low index values (1.1–3.0) (457–457). One \\nstudy reported an overall specificity of 57.4%, with a specificity \\nof 39.8% for index values of 1.1–2.9 (458). Because of the \\npoor specificity of commercially available type-specific EIAs, \\nparticularly with low index values (<3.0), a confirmatory test \\n(Biokit or Western blot) with a second method should be \\nperformed before test interpretation. Use of confirmatory \\ntesting with the Biokit or the Western blot assays have been \\nreported to improve accuracy of HSV-2 serologic testing (459). \\nThe HerpeSelect HSV-2 immunoblot should not be used for \\nconfirmation because it uses the same antigen as the HSV-2 \\nEIA. If confirmatory tests are unavailable, patients should be \\ncounseled about the limitations of available testing before \\nobtaining serologic tests, and health care providers should \\nbe aware that false-positive results occur. Immunoglobulin \\nM (IgM) testing for HSV-1 or HSV-2 is not useful because \\nIgM tests are not type specific and might be positive during \\nrecurrent genital or oral episodes of herpes (460). Therefore, \\nHSV IgM testing is not recommended.\\n\\nBecause approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually \\nacquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies \\nanogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling \\nfor persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. \\nThe presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult \\nto interpret. HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish \\nbetween oral and genital infection and typically should not \\nbe performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection. Persons \\nwith HSV-1 antibodies often have oral HSV infection acquired \\nduring childhood, which might be asymptomatic. Lack of \\nsymptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does not \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 31US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ndistinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, \\nand, regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk \\nfor acquiring HSV-2. In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing \\nhas low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody (458). \\nHowever, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, \\nand HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic (437–\\n439,461,462). Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by \\nvirologic tests from genital lesions.\\n\\nType-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing \\nHSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or \\natypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV \\nPCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes \\nwithout laboratory confirmation, and a patient’s partner has \\ngenital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general \\npopulation is not recommended. Patients who are at higher \\nrisk for infection (e.g., those presenting for an STI evaluation, \\nespecially for persons with ≥10 lifetime sex partners, and \\npersons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a \\nhistory of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific \\nHSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with \\ngenital symptoms.\\n\\nGenital Herpes Management\\nAntiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic \\n\\npatients and is the mainstay of management. The goals for \\nuse of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection \\nare to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences \\nand improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent \\ntransmission to sexual partners. Counseling regarding the \\nnatural history of genital herpes, risks for sexual and perinatal \\ntransmission, and methods for reducing transmission is also \\nintegral to clinical management.\\n\\nSystemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and \\nsymptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and \\nrecurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. \\nHowever, these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect \\nthe risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug \\nis discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three \\nFDA-approved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit \\nfor genital herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir \\n(463–471). Valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has \\nenhanced absorption after oral administration, allowing for \\nless frequent dosing than acyclovir. Famciclovir also has high \\noral bioavailability. Topical therapy with antiviral drugs offers \\nminimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.\\n\\nFirst Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes\\nNewly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged \\n\\nclinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic \\ninvolvement. Even persons with first-episode herpes who have \\n\\nmild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or \\nprolonged symptoms during recurrent infection. Therefore, \\nall patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive \\nantiviral therapy.\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for First Clinical Episode of Genital \\nHerpes*\\n\\nAcyclovir† 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days\\nor\\n\\nFamciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days\\nor\\n\\nValacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days\\n\\n* Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy.\\n† Acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times/day is also effective but is not \\n\\nrecommended because of the frequency of dosing.\\n\\nRecurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes\\nAlmost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 \\n\\ngenital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of \\ngenital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs \\namong persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even \\nthose with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral \\ntherapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either \\nas suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences \\nor episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. \\nCertain persons, including those with mild or infrequent \\nrecurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, \\noptions for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer \\nsuppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of \\ndecreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to \\nsusceptible partners (472,473).\\n\\nSuppressive Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 \\nGenital Herpes\\n\\nSuppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes \\nrecurrences by 70%–80% among patients who have frequent \\nrecurrences (469–472). Persons receiving such therapy \\noften report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. \\nSuppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less \\nfrequent recurrences. Long-term safety and efficacy have \\nbeen documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, \\nvalacyclovir, and famciclovir (474). Quality of life is improved \\nfor many patients with frequent recurrences who receive \\nsuppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment (475). \\nProviders should discuss with patients on an annual basis \\nwhether they want to continue suppressive therapy because \\nfrequency of genital HSV-2 recurrence diminishes over time \\nfor many persons. However, neither treatment discontinuation \\nnor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events \\nand development of HSV antiviral resistance related to long-\\nterm antiviral use are uncommon.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n32 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nTreatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate \\nof HSV-2 transmission for discordant heterosexual couples \\nin which a partner has a history of genital HSV-2 infection \\n(473). Such couples should be encouraged to consider \\nsuppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy for preventing \\ntransmission, in addition to consistent condom use and \\navoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive \\nantiviral therapy for persons with a history of symptomatic \\ngenital herpes also is likely to reduce transmission when used \\nby those who have multiple partners. HSV-2 seropositive \\npersons without a history of symptomatic genital herpes \\nhave a 50% decreased risk for genital shedding, compared \\nwith those with symptomatic genital herpes (476). No data \\nare available regarding efficacy of suppressive therapy for \\npreventing HSV-2 transmission among discordant couples in \\nwhich a partner has a history of asymptomatic HSV-2 infection \\nidentified by a positive HSV-2 serologic test. Among HSV-2 \\nseropositive persons without HIV infection, oral TDF/FTC \\nand intravaginal tenofovir are ineffective at reducing the risk \\nfor HSV-2 shedding or recurrences (477).\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Suppression of Recurrent HSV-2 \\nGenital Herpes\\n\\nAcyclovir 400 mg orally 2 times/day\\nor\\n\\nValacyclovir 500 mg orally once a day*\\nor\\n\\nValacyclovir 1 g orally once a day\\nor\\n\\nFamciclovir 250 mg orally 2 times/day\\n\\n* Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other \\nvalacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens for persons who have frequent \\nrecurrences (i.e., ≥10 episodes/year).\\n\\nFamciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of \\nviral shedding (478). Ease of administration and cost also are \\nkey considerations for prolonged treatment.\\n\\nRecurrent HSV-1 Genital Herpes\\nRecurrences are less frequent after the first episode of HSV-1 \\n\\ngenital herpes, compared with genital HSV-2 genital herpes, \\nand genital shedding rapidly decreases during the first year of \\ninfection (479). No data are available regarding the efficacy \\nof suppressive therapy for preventing transmission among \\npersons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection. Because of \\nthe decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive \\ntherapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those \\nwith frequent recurrences through shared clinical decision-\\nmaking between the patient and the provider.\\n\\nEpisodic Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes\\nEpisodic treatment of recurrent herpes is most effective if \\n\\ntherapy is initiated within 1 day of lesion onset or during the \\n\\nprodrome that precedes some outbreaks. The patient should \\nbe provided with a supply of drug or a prescription for the \\nmedication with instructions to initiate treatment immediately \\nwhen symptoms begin. Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir \\nappear equally effective for episodic treatment of genital herpes \\n(466–470).\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Episodic Therapy for Recurrent \\nHSV-2 Genital Herpes*\\n\\nAcyclovir 800 mg orally 2 times/day for 5 days\\nor\\n\\nAcyclovir 800 mg orally 3 times/day for 2 days\\nor\\n\\nFamciclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 1 day\\nor\\n\\nFamciclovir 500 mg orally once, followed by 250 mg 2 times/day for \\n2 days\\n\\nor\\nFamciclovir 125 mg orally 2 times/day for 5 days\\n\\nor\\nValacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days\\n\\nor\\nValacyclovir 1 g orally once daily for 5 days\\n\\n* Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 5 days is also effective but is not \\nrecommended because of frequency of dosing.\\n\\nSevere Disease\\nIntravenous (IV) acyclovir therapy (5–10 mg/kg body weight \\n\\nIV every 8 hours) should be provided for patients who have severe \\nHSV disease or complications that necessitate hospitalization \\n(e.g., disseminated infection, pneumonitis, or hepatitis) or \\nCNS complications (e.g., meningitis or encephalitis). HSV-2 \\nmeningitis is a rare complication of HSV-2 genital herpes \\ninfection that affects women more than men (480). IV therapy \\nshould be considered until clinical improvement followed by \\noral antiviral therapy to complete >10 days of total therapy. \\nLonger duration is recommended for CNS complications. \\nHSV-2 meningitis is characterized clinically by signs of \\nheadache, photophobia, fever, meningismus, and cerebrospinal \\nfluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis, accompanied by mildly \\nelevated protein and normal glucose (481). Optimal therapies \\nfor HSV-2 meningitis have not been well studied (482); \\nhowever, acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours \\nuntil clinical improvement is observed, followed by high-dose \\noral antiviral therapy (valacyclovir 1 g 3 times/day) to complete \\na 10- to 14-day course of total therapy, is recommended. \\nFor patients with previous episodes of documented HSV-2 \\nmeningitis, oral valacyclovir may be used for the entire \\ncourse during episodes of recurrent HSV-2 meningitis. A \\nrandomized clinical trial indicated that suppressive therapy \\n(valacyclovir 500 mg 2 times/day) did not prevent recurrent \\nHSV-2 meningitis episodes; however, the dose might not \\nhave been sufficient for CNS penetration (483). Valacyclovir \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 33US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n500 mg 2 times/day is not recommended for suppression of \\nHSV-2 meningitis; higher doses have not been studied in \\nclinical trials. HSV meningitis should be distinguished from \\nencephalitis, which requires a longer course (14–21 days) of \\nIV therapy. Impaired renal function warrants an adjustment \\nin acyclovir dosage.\\n\\nHepatitis\\nHepatitis is a rare manifestation of disseminated HSV \\n\\ninfection, often reported among pregnant women who \\nacquire HSV during pregnancy (484). Pregnant women in \\nany trimester can present with fever and hepatitis (markedly \\nelevated transaminases) but might not have any genital or skin \\nlesions. HSV hepatitis is associated with fulminant liver failure \\nand high mortality (25%). Therefore, a high index of suspicion \\nfor HSV is necessary, with a confirmatory diagnosis by HSV \\nPCR from blood (485). Among pregnant women with fever \\nand unexplained severe hepatitis, disseminated HSV infection \\nshould be considered, and empiric IV acyclovir should be \\ninitiated pending confirmation (484).\\n\\nPrevention\\nConsistent and correct condom use has been reported \\n\\nin multiple studies to decrease, but not eliminate, the risk \\nfor HSV-2 transmission from men to women (486–488). \\nCondoms are less effective for preventing transmission from \\nwomen to men (489). Two randomized clinical trials of \\nmedical male circumcision (MMC) demonstrated a decreased \\nrisk for HSV-2 acquisition among men in Uganda and \\nSouth Africa (66,68). Results from a third trial conducted \\nin Kenya did not demonstrate a substantial difference in \\nHSV-2 acquisition among men who received MMC (490). \\nA systematic review indicated high consistency for decreased \\nrisk for HSV-2 acquisition among women with a male partner \\nwho underwent MMC (491). These data indicate that MMC \\ncan be associated with decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition \\namong adult heterosexual men and with decreased risk for \\nHSV-2 transmission from male to female partners.\\n\\nRandomized clinical trials have demonstrated that PrEP with \\ndaily oral TDF/FTC decreases the risk for HSV-2 acquisition \\nby 30% in heterosexual partnerships (492). Pericoital \\nintravaginal tenofovir 1% gel also decreases the risk for HSV-2 \\nacquisition among heterosexual women (493). Among MSM \\nand transgender women, daily oral TDF/FTC decreases the \\nrisk for severe ulcers with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection \\nbut not for HSV-2 acquisition (494). Insufficient evidence \\nexists that TDF/FTC use among those who are not at risk for \\nHIV acquisition will prevent HSV-2 infection, and it should \\nnot be used for that sole purpose. Oral TDF does not prevent \\nHSV-2 acquisition among persons with HIV infection who \\n\\nare taking TDF as part of their ART regimen (495). No data \\nindicate that antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) \\ncan be taken as PrEP by persons without HSV-2 to prevent \\nits acquisition.\\n\\nCounseling\\nCounseling of persons with genital herpes and their sex \\n\\npartners is crucial for management. The goals of counseling \\ninclude helping patients cope with the infection and preventing \\nsexual and perinatal transmission. Although initial counseling \\ncan be provided at the first visit, patients often benefit from \\nlearning about the chronic aspects of the disease after the acute \\nillness subsides. Multiple resources, including Internet sites and \\nprinted materials, are available to assist patients, their partners, \\nand clinicians who provide counseling (496,497) (https://www.\\nashasexualhealth.org and https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes).\\n\\nAlthough the psychological effect of a serologic diagnosis of \\nHSV-2 infection in a person with asymptomatic or unrecognized \\ngenital herpes appears minimal and transient (498,499), certain \\npersons with HSV infection might express anxiety concerning \\ngenital herpes that does not reflect the actual clinical severity \\nof their disease; the psychological effect of HSV infection can \\nbe substantial. Common concerns about genital herpes include \\nthe severity of initial clinical manifestations, recurrent episodes, \\nsexual relationships and transmission to sex partners, and ability \\nto bear healthy children.\\n\\nSymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes\\nWhen counseling persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital \\n\\nherpes infection, the provider should discuss the following:\\n• The natural history of the disease, with emphasis on the \\n\\npotential for recurrent episodes, asymptomatic viral \\nshedding, and the attendant risks for sexual transmission \\nof HSV to occur during asymptomatic periods \\n(asymptomatic viral shedding is most frequent during the \\nfirst 12 months after acquiring HSV-2).\\n\\n• The effectiveness of daily suppressive antiviral therapy for \\npreventing symptomatic recurrent episodes of genital \\nherpes for persons experiencing a first episode or recurrent \\ngenital herpes.\\n\\n• The effectiveness of daily use of valacyclovir in reducing \\nrisk for transmission of HSV-2 among persons without \\nHIV (473) and use of episodic therapy to shorten the \\nduration of recurrent episodes.\\n\\n• The importance of informing current sex partners about \\ngenital herpes and informing future partners before \\ninitiating a sexual relationship.\\n\\n• The importance of abstaining from sexual activity with \\nuninfected partners when lesions or prodromal symptoms \\nare present.\\n\\nhttps://www.ashasexualhealth.org\\nhttps://www.ashasexualhealth.org\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n34 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n• The effectiveness of male latex condoms, which when used \\nconsistently and correctly can reduce, but not eliminate, \\nthe risk for genital herpes transmission (486–488).\\n\\n• The type-specific serologic testing of partners of persons \\nwith symptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes to determine \\nwhether such partners are already HSV seropositive or \\nwhether risk for acquiring HSV exists.\\n\\n• The low risk for neonatal HSV except when genital herpes \\nis acquired late in pregnancy or if prodrome or lesions are \\npresent at delivery.\\n\\n• The increased risk for HIV acquisition among HSV-2 \\nseropositive persons who are exposed to HIV (76,471). \\n\\n• The lack of effectiveness of episodic or suppressive therapy \\namong persons with HIV infection to reduce risk for \\ntransmission to partners who might be at risk for \\nHSV-2 acquisition.\\n\\nAsymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes\\nWhen counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital \\n\\nherpes infection, the provider should consider the following:\\n• Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 \\n\\nby type-specific serologic testing (with confirmatory testing, \\nif needed) should receive education about the symptoms of \\ngenital herpes infection (see Diagnostic Considerations).\\n\\n• Episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used \\npredominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, \\nand prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with \\nsymptomatic HSV-2 infection.\\n\\n• For patients with serological evidence of HSV-2 (with \\ncombination testing if needed) without symptomatic \\nrecurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is \\nindicated for prevention of recurrences (see Diagnostic \\nConsiderations).\\n\\n• Among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy \\nof suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to \\nsex partners has not been studied.\\n\\n• Because of the decreased risk for shedding among those \\nwith asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of \\nsuppressive therapy for preventing transmission is \\nunknown among this population.\\n\\nHSV-1 Genital Herpes\\nWhen counseling persons with HSV-1 genital herpes \\n\\ninfection, the provider should consider the following:\\n• Persons with virologic laboratory-documented \\n\\nsymptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be \\neducated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and \\ngenital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared \\nwith HSV-2 infection.\\n\\n• Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, \\nsuppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be \\nreserved for those with frequent recurrences.\\n\\n• For patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital \\nherpes, suppressive therapy might be considered. \\nSuppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex \\npartners has not been studied.\\n\\nFor persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or \\nasymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can \\nbe considered for those who have substantial psychosocial \\ndistress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes. For women \\nwho have genital herpes, the providers who care for them \\nduring pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn \\ninfant should be informed of their infection (see Genital \\nHerpes During Pregnancy).\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nThe sex partners of persons who have symptomatic \\n\\ngenital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling. \\nSymptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in \\nthe same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital \\nherpes. Asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have \\nsymptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history \\nof genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing \\nfor HSV-2. For partners without genital herpes, no data are \\navailable on which to base a recommendation for PEP or \\nPrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent \\nacquisition, and this should not be offered to patients as a \\nprevention strategy.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions\\nAllergic and other adverse reactions to oral acyclovir, \\n\\nvalacyclovir, and famciclovir are rare. Desensitization to \\nacyclovir has been described (500).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nImmunocompromised patients can have prolonged or severe \\n\\nepisodes of genital, perianal, or oral herpes. Lesions caused by \\nHSV are common among persons with HIV infection and \\nmight be severe, painful, and atypical (501). HSV shedding is \\nincreased among persons with HIV infection (502). Whereas \\nART reduces the severity and frequency of symptomatic genital \\nherpes, frequent subclinical shedding still occurs (503,504). \\nClinical manifestations of genital herpes might worsen during \\nimmune reconstitution early after initiation of ART. HSV-2 \\ntype-specific serologic testing can be considered for persons \\nwith HIV infection during their initial evaluation, particularly \\namong those with a history of genital symptoms indicative of \\nHSV infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 35US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nRecommended therapy for first-episode genital herpes is \\nthe same as for persons without HIV infection, although \\ntreatment courses might need to be extended for lesion \\nresolution. Suppressive or episodic therapy with oral antiviral \\nagents is effective in decreasing the clinical manifestations of \\nHSV infection among persons with HIV (503,504). The risk \\nfor GUD increases during the first 6 months after starting \\nART, especially among persons who have a CD4+ T-cell count \\n<200 cell/mm3. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the risk \\nfor GUD among this population and can be continued for \\n6 months after ART initiation (504) when the risk for GUD \\nreturns to baseline levels. Suppressive antiviral therapy among \\npersons with HIV and HSV infection does not reduce the \\nrisk for either HIV transmission or HSV-2 transmission to \\nsusceptible sex partners (88,505). Suppressive antiviral therapy \\ndoes not delay HIV disease progression and is not associated \\nwith decreased risk for HIV-related inflammation among \\npersons taking ART (506). For severe HSV disease, initiating \\ntherapy with acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours might \\nbe necessary.\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Daily Suppression of Genital \\nHerpes Among Persons with HIV Infection\\n\\nAcyclovir 400–800 mg orally 2–3 times/day\\nor\\n\\nFamciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day\\nor\\n\\nValacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Episodic Genital Herpes Infection \\nAmong Persons with HIV Infection\\n\\nAcyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 5–10 days\\nor\\n\\nFamciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 5–10 days\\nor\\n\\nValacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 5–10 days\\n\\nAntiviral-Resistant HSV Infection\\nIf lesions persist or recur in a patient receiving antiviral \\n\\ntreatment, acyclovir resistance should be suspected and a viral \\nculture obtained for phenotypic sensitivity testing (507). \\nMolecular testing for acyclovir resistance is not available. \\nSuch persons should be managed in consultation with an \\ninfectious disease specialist, and alternative therapy should be \\nadministered. All acyclovir-resistant strains are also resistant \\nto valacyclovir, and the majority are resistant to famciclovir. \\nFoscarnet (40–80 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours until \\nclinical resolution is attained) is the treatment of choice for \\nacyclovir-resistant genital herpes (508,509). Intravenous \\ncidofovir 5 mg/kg body weight once weekly might also be \\neffective. Foscarnet and cidofovir are nephrotoxic medications \\nthat require intensive laboratory monitoring and infectious \\n\\ndisease specialist consultation. Imiquimod 5% applied to the lesion \\nfor 8 hours 3 times/week until clinical resolution is an alternative \\nthat has been reported to be effective (510,511). Topical cidofovir \\ngel 1% can be applied to lesions 2–4 times daily; however, cidofovir \\nmust be compounded at a pharmacy (512).\\n\\nPrevention of antiviral resistance remains challenging among \\npersons with HIV infection. Experience with another group \\nof immunocompromised persons (e.g., hematopoietic stem-\\ncell recipients) demonstrated that persons receiving daily \\nsuppressive antiviral therapy were less likely to experience \\nacyclovir-resistant HSV infection compared with those who \\nreceived episodic therapy for outbreaks (513).\\n\\nGenital Herpes During Pregnancy\\nPrevention of neonatal herpes depends both on preventing \\n\\nacquisition of genital herpes during late pregnancy and \\navoiding exposure of the neonate to herpetic lesions and viral \\nshedding during delivery. Mothers of newborns who acquire \\nneonatal herpes often lack histories of clinically evident genital \\nherpes (514,515). The risk for transmission to the neonate from \\nan infected mother is high (30%–50%) among women who \\nacquire genital herpes near the time of delivery and low (<1%) \\namong women with prenatal histories of recurrent herpes or \\nwho acquire genital herpes during the first half of pregnancy \\n(516,517). Women who acquire HSV in the second half of \\npregnancy should be managed in consultation with maternal-\\nfetal medicine and infectious disease specialists.\\n\\nAll pregnant women should be asked whether they have \\na history of genital herpes or genital symptoms concerning \\nfor HSV infection. At the onset of labor, all women should \\nbe questioned thoroughly about symptoms of genital herpes, \\nincluding prodromal symptoms (e.g., pain or burning at site \\nbefore appearance of lesion), and all women should be examined \\nthoroughly for herpetic lesions. Women without symptoms or \\nsigns of genital herpes or its prodrome can deliver vaginally. \\nAlthough cesarean delivery does not eliminate the risk for HSV \\ntransmission to the neonate (517), women with recurrent genital \\nherpetic lesions at the onset of labor should have a cesarean \\ndelivery to reduce the risk for neonatal HSV infection.\\n\\nRoutine HSV-2 serologic screening of pregnant women is not \\nrecommended. Women without known genital herpes should \\nbe counseled to abstain from vaginal intercourse during the \\nthird trimester with partners known to have or suspected of \\nhaving genital herpes. In addition, to prevent HSV-1 genital \\nherpes, pregnant women without known orolabial herpes \\nshould be advised to abstain from receptive oral sex during the \\nthird trimester with partners known to have or suspected to \\nhave orolabial herpes. Type-specific serologic tests can be useful \\nfor identifying pregnant women at risk for HSV infection and \\nfor guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n36 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nherpes during pregnancy. For example, such testing might be \\noffered to a woman with no history of genital herpes whose \\nsex partner has HSV infection. Many fetuses are exposed to \\nacyclovir each year, and the medication is believed to be safe \\nfor use during all trimesters of pregnancy. A case-control study \\nreported an increased risk for the rare neonatal outcome of \\ngastroschisis among women who used antiviral medications \\nbetween the month before conception and the third month of \\npregnancy (518). Acyclovir is also believed to be safe during \\nbreastfeeding (431,519). Although data regarding prenatal \\nexposure to valacyclovir and famciclovir are limited, data from \\nanimal trials indicate that these drugs also pose a low risk \\namong pregnant women (520). Acyclovir can be administered \\norally to pregnant women with first-episode genital herpes or \\nrecurrent herpes and should be administered IV to pregnant \\nwomen with severe HSV (see Genital Herpes, Hepatitis). \\nSuppressive acyclovir treatment starting at 36 weeks’ gestation \\nreduces the frequency of cesarean delivery among women who \\nhave recurrent genital herpes by diminishing the frequency of \\nrecurrences at term (521–523). However, such treatment might \\nnot protect against transmission to neonates in all cases (524). \\nNo data support use of antiviral therapy among asymptomatic \\nHSV-seropositive women without a history of genital herpes. \\nIn addition, the effectiveness of antiviral therapy among sex \\npartners with a history of genital herpes to decrease the risk \\nfor HSV transmission to a pregnant woman has not been \\nstudied. Additional information on the clinical management \\nof genital herpes in pregnancy is available through existing \\nguidelines (525).\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Suppression of Recurrent Genital \\nHerpes Among Pregnant Women*\\nAcyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day\\n\\nor\\nValacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day\\n\\n* Treatment recommended starting at 36 weeks’ gestation.\\n\\nNeonatal Herpes\\nNewborn infants exposed to HSV during birth, as \\n\\ndocumented by virologic testing of maternal lesions at delivery \\nor presumed by observation of maternal lesions, should be \\nfollowed clinically in consultation with a pediatric infectious \\ndisease specialist. Detailed guidance is available regarding \\nmanagement of neonates who are delivered vaginally in the \\npresence of maternal genital herpes lesions and is beyond the \\nscope of these guidelines; more information is available from \\nthe AAP (https://redbook.solutions.aap.org). Surveillance \\ncultures or PCR of mucosal surfaces of the neonate to detect \\nHSV infection might be considered before the development of \\n\\nclinical signs of neonatal herpes to guide treatment initiation. \\nIn addition, administration of acyclovir might be considered \\nfor neonates born to women who acquired HSV near term \\nbecause the risk for neonatal herpes is high for these newborn \\ninfants. All newborn infants who have neonatal herpes should \\nbe promptly evaluated and treated with systemic acyclovir. \\nThe recommended regimen for infants treated for known or \\nsuspected neonatal herpes is acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight \\nIV every 8 hours for 14 days if disease is limited to the skin and \\nmucous membranes, or for 21 days for disseminated disease \\nand disease involving the CNS.\\n\\nGranuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis)\\nGranuloma inguinale (donovanosis) is a genital ulcerative \\n\\ndisease caused by the intracellular gram-negative bacterium \\nKlebsiella granulomatis (formerly known as Calymmatobacterium \\ngranulomatis). The disease occurs rarely in the United States; \\nhowever, sporadic cases have been described in India, South \\nAfrica, and South America (526–535). Although granuloma \\ninguinale was previously endemic in Australia, it is now \\nextremely rare (536,537). Clinically, the disease is characterized \\nas painless, slowly progressive ulcerative lesions on the genitals \\nor perineum without regional lymphadenopathy; subcutaneous \\ngranulomas (pseudobuboes) also might occur. The lesions \\nare highly vascular (i.e., beefy red appearance) and can bleed. \\nExtragenital infection can occur with infection extension to \\nthe pelvis, or it can disseminate to intra-abdominal organs, \\nbones, or the mouth. The lesions also can develop secondary \\nbacterial infection and can coexist with other sexually \\ntransmitted pathogens.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nThe causative organism of granuloma inguinale is difficult \\n\\nto culture, and diagnosis requires visualization of dark-staining \\nDonovan bodies on tissue crush preparation or biopsy. \\nAlthough no FDA-cleared molecular tests for the detection of \\nK. granulomatis DNA exist, molecular assays might be useful \\nfor identifying the causative agent.\\n\\nTreatment\\nMultiple antimicrobial regimens have been effective; \\n\\nhowever, only a limited number of controlled trials have \\nbeen published (538). Treatment has been reported to halt \\nprogression of lesions, and healing typically proceeds inward \\nfrom the ulcer margins. Prolonged therapy is usually required to \\npermit granulation and reepithelialization of the ulcers. Relapse \\ncan occur 6–18 months after apparently effective therapy.\\n\\nhttps://redbook.solutions.aap.org\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 37US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis)\\n\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally once/week or 500 mg daily for >3 weeks and \\nuntil all lesions have completely healed\\n\\nAlternative Regimens\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for at least 3 weeks and until all \\nlesions have completely healed\\n\\nor\\nErythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 times/day for >3 weeks and until all \\nlesions have completely healed\\n\\nor\\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole one double-strength (160 mg/800 \\nmg) tablet orally 2 time/day for >3 weeks and until all lesions have \\ncompletely healed\\n\\nThe addition of another antibiotic to these regimens can be \\nconsidered if improvement is not evident within the first few \\ndays of therapy.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nPatients should be followed clinically until signs and \\n\\nsymptoms have resolved. All persons who receive a diagnosis \\nof granuloma inguinale should be tested for HIV.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nPatients should be followed clinically until signs and \\n\\nsymptoms resolve.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nPersons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has \\n\\ngranuloma inguinale within the 60 days before onset of the \\npatient’s symptoms should be examined and offered therapy. \\nHowever, the value of empiric therapy in the absence of clinical \\nsigns and symptoms has not been established.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nUse of doxycycline in pregnancy might be associated \\n\\nwith discoloration of teeth; however, the risk is not well \\ndefined. Doxycycline is compatible with breastfeeding (431). \\nSulfonamides can be associated with neonatal kernicterus \\namong those with glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase \\ndeficiency and should be avoided during the third trimester \\nand while breastfeeding (431). For these reasons, pregnant and \\nlactating women with granuloma inguinale should be treated \\nwith a macrolide regimen (erythromycin or azithromycin).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with granuloma inguinale and HIV infection should \\n\\nreceive the same regimens as those who do not have HIV.\\n\\nLymphogranuloma Venereum\\nLGV is caused by C. trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3 \\n\\n(539,540). LGV can cause severe inflammation and invasive \\ninfection, in contrast with C. trachomatis serovars A–K that \\ncause mild or asymptomatic infection. Clinical manifestations \\nof LGV can include GUD, lymphadenopathy, or proctocolitis. \\nRectal exposure among MSM or women can result in \\nproctocolitis, which is the most common presentation of \\nLGV infection (541), and can mimic inflammatory bowel \\ndisease with clinical findings of mucoid or hemorrhagic \\nrectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, or tenesmus \\n(542,543). Outbreaks of LGV proctocolitis have been \\nreported among MSM with high rates of HIV infection \\n(544–547). LGV proctocolitis can be an invasive, systemic \\ninfection and, if it is not treated early, can lead to chronic \\ncolorectal fistulas and strictures; reactive arthropathy has also \\nbeen reported. However, reports indicate that rectal LGV can \\nalso be asymptomatic (548). A common clinical manifestation \\nof LGV among heterosexuals is tender inguinal or femoral \\nlymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral. A self-limited \\ngenital ulcer or papule sometimes occurs at the site of inoculation. \\nHowever, by the time persons seek care, the lesions have often \\ndisappeared. LGV-associated lymphadenopathy can be severe, \\nwith bubo formation from fluctuant or suppurative inguinal or \\nfemoral lymphadenopathy. Oral ulceration can occur and might \\nbe associated with cervical adenopathy (549–551). Persons with \\ngenital or colorectal LGV lesions can also experience secondary \\nbacterial infection or can be infected with other sexually and \\nnonsexually transmitted pathogens.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nA definitive LGV diagnosis can be made only with LGV-\\n\\nspecific molecular testing (e.g., PCR-based genotyping). These \\ntests can differentiate LGV from non–LGV C. trachomatis in \\nrectal specimens. However, these tests are not widely available, \\nand results are not typically available in a time frame that \\nwould influence clinical management. Therefore, diagnosis is \\nbased on clinical suspicion, epidemiologic information, and a \\nC. trachomatis NAAT at the symptomatic anatomic site, along \\nwith exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis, inguinal \\nlymphadenopathy, or genital, oral, or rectal ulcers (551,552). \\nGenital or oral lesions, rectal specimens, and lymph node \\nspecimens (i.e., lesion swab or bubo aspirate) can be tested \\nfor C. trachomatis by NAAT or culture. NAAT is the preferred \\napproach for testing because it can detect both LGV strains and \\nnon–LGV C. trachomatis strains (553). Therefore, all persons \\npresenting with proctocolitis should be tested for chlamydia \\nwith a NAAT performed on rectal specimens. Severe symptoms \\nof proctocolitis (e.g., bloody discharge, tenesmus, and rectal \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n38 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nulcers) indicate LGV. A rectal Gram stain with >10 white \\nblood cells (WBCs) has also been associated with rectal LGV \\n(545,554,555).\\n\\nChlamydia  se ro logy  (complement  f ixa t ion  or \\nmicroimmunofluorescence) should not be used routinely as a \\ndiagnostic tool for LGV because the utility of these serologic \\nmethods has not been established, interpretation has not been \\nstandardized, and validation for clinical proctitis presentation \\nhas not been done. It might support an LGV diagnosis in \\ncases of isolated inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy for \\nwhich diagnostic material for C. trachomatis NAAT cannot \\nbe obtained.\\n\\nTreatment\\nAt the time of the initial visit (before diagnostic NAATs \\n\\nfor chlamydia are available), persons with a clinical syndrome \\nconsistent with LGV should be presumptively treated. \\nPresumptive treatment for LGV is indicated among patients \\nwith symptoms or signs of proctocolitis (e.g., bloody \\ndischarge, tenesmus, or ulceration); in cases of severe inguinal \\nlymphadenopathy with bubo formation, particularly if the \\npatient has a recent history of a genital ulcer; or in the presence \\nof a genital ulcer if other etiologies have been ruled out. The \\ngoal of treatment is to cure infection and prevent ongoing tissue \\ndamage, although tissue reaction to the infection can result in \\nscarring. Buboes might require aspiration through intact skin \\nor incision and drainage to prevent formation of inguinal or \\nfemoral ulcerations.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Lymphogranuloma Venereum\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 21 days\\n\\nAlternative Regimens\\n\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks*\\nor\\n\\nErythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 times/day for 21 days\\n\\n* Because this regimen has not been validated, a test of cure with C. trachomatis \\nNAAT 4 weeks after completion of treatment can be considered.\\n\\nThe optimal treatment duration for symptomatic LGV has \\nnot been studied in clinical trials. The recommended 21-day \\ncourse of doxycycline is based on long-standing clinical practice \\nand is highly effective, with an estimated cure rate of >98.5% \\n(555,556). Shorter courses of doxycycline might be effective \\non the basis of a small retrospective study of MSM with rectal \\nLGV, 50% of whom were symptomatic, who received a 7- to \\n14-day course of doxycycline and had a 97% cure rate (558). \\nRandomized prospective studies of shorter-course doxycycline \\nfor treating LGV are needed. Longer courses of therapy might \\nbe required in the setting of fistulas, buboes, and other forms \\nof severe disease (559).\\n\\nA small nonrandomized study from Spain involving patients \\nwith rectal LGV demonstrated cure rates of 97% with a \\nregimen of azithromycin 1 g once weekly for 3 weeks (560). \\nPharmacokinetic data support this dosing strategy (561); \\nhowever, this regimen has not been validated. Fluoroquinolone-\\nbased treatments also might be effective; however, the optimal \\nduration of treatment has not been evaluated. The clinical \\nsignificance of asymptomatic LGV is unknown, and it is \\neffectively treated with a 7-day course of doxycycline (562). \\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nPatients should be followed clinically until signs and \\n\\nsymptoms have resolved. Persons who receive an LGV diagnosis \\nshould be tested for other STIs, especially HIV, gonorrhea, and \\nsyphilis. Those whose HIV test results are negative should be \\noffered HIV PrEP.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nAll persons who have been treated for LGV should be retested \\n\\nfor chlamydia approximately 3 months after treatment. If \\nretesting at 3 months is not possible, providers should retest \\nat the patient’s next visit for medical care within the 12-month \\nperiod after initial treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nPersons who have had sexual contact with a patient who \\n\\nhas LGV within the 60 days before onset of the patient’s \\nsymptoms should be evaluated, examined, and tested for \\nchlamydial infection, depending on anatomic site of exposure. \\nAsymptomatic partners should be presumptively treated with \\na chlamydia regimen (doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day \\nfor 7 days).\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nUse of doxycycline in pregnancy might be associated with \\n\\ndiscoloration of teeth; however, the risk is not well defined \\n(563). Doxycycline is compatible with breastfeeding (431). \\nAzithromycin might prove useful for LGV treatment during \\npregnancy, at a presumptive dose of 1 g weekly for 3 weeks; \\nno published data are available regarding an effective dose and \\nduration of treatment. Pregnant and lactating women with \\nLGV can be treated with erythromycin, although this regimen \\nis associated with frequent gastrointestinal side effects. Pregnant \\nwomen treated for LGV should have a test of cure performed \\n4 weeks after the initial C. trachomatis NAAT-positive test.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 39US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with LGV and HIV infection should receive the \\n\\nsame regimens as those who do not have HIV. Prolonged \\ntherapy might be required because a delay in resolution of \\nsymptoms might occur.\\n\\nSyphilis\\nSyphilis is a systemic disease caused by T. pallidum. The \\n\\ndisease has been divided into stages on the basis of clinical \\nfindings, which guide treatment and follow-up. Persons who \\nhave syphilis might seek treatment for signs or symptoms. \\nPrimary syphilis classically presents as a single painless ulcer \\nor chancre at the site of infection but can also present with \\nmultiple, atypical, or painful lesions (564). Secondary syphilis \\nmanifestations can include skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions, \\nand lymphadenopathy. Tertiary syphilis can present with \\ncardiac involvement, gummatous lesions, tabes dorsalis, and \\ngeneral paresis.\\n\\nLatent infections (i.e., those lacking clinical manifestations) \\nare detected by serologic testing. Latent syphilis acquired \\nwithin the preceding year is referred to as early latent syphilis; \\nall other cases of latent syphilis are classified as late latent \\nsyphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration.\\n\\nT. pallidum can infect the CNS, which can occur at any stage \\nof syphilis and result in neurosyphilis. Early neurologic clinical \\nmanifestations or syphilitic meningitis (e.g., cranial nerve \\ndysfunction, meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, stroke, \\nand acute altered mental status) are usually present within \\nthe first few months or years of infection. Late neurologic \\nmanifestations (e.g., tabes dorsalis and general paresis) occur \\n10 to >30 years after infection.\\n\\nInfection of the visual system (ocular syphilis) or auditory \\nsystem (otosyphilis) can occur at any stage of syphilis but is \\ncommonly identified during the early stages and can present \\nwith or without additional CNS involvement. Ocular syphilis \\noften presents as panuveitis but can involve structures in \\nboth the anterior and posterior segment of the eye, including \\nconjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, posterior interstitial keratitis, \\noptic neuropathy, and retinal vasculitis. Ocular syphilis can \\nresult in permanent vision loss. Otosyphilis typically presents \\nwith cochleo-vestibular symptoms, including tinnitus, vertigo, \\nand sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss can be unilateral or \\nbilateral, have a sudden onset, and progress rapidly. Otosyphilis \\ncan result in permanent hearing loss.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nDarkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting \\n\\nT. pallidum directly from lesion exudate or tissue are \\nthe definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and \\ncongenital syphilis (565). Although no T. pallidum direct-\\ndetection molecular NAATs are commercially available, \\ncertain laboratories provide locally developed and validated \\nPCR tests for detecting T. pallidum DNA. A presumptive \\ndiagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic \\ntests: a nontreponemal test (i.e., Venereal Disease Research \\nLaboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) \\nand a treponemal test (i.e., the T. pallidum passive particle \\nagglutination [TP-PA] assay, various EIAs, chemiluminescence \\nimmunoassays [CIAs] and immunoblots, or rapid treponemal \\nassays) (566–568). At least 18 treponemal-specific tests are \\ncleared for use in the United States. Use of only one type of \\nserologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient \\nfor diagnosis and can result in false-negative results among \\npersons tested during primary syphilis and false-positive results \\namong persons without syphilis or previously treated syphilis.\\n\\nNontreponemal Tests and Traditional Algorithm\\nFalse-positive nontreponemal test results can be associated \\n\\nwith multiple medical conditions and factors unrelated to \\nsyphilis, including other infections (e.g., HIV), autoimmune \\nconditions, vaccinations, injecting drug use, pregnancy, \\nand older age (566,569). Therefore, persons with a reactive \\nnontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test \\nto confirm the syphilis diagnosis (i.e., traditional algorithm). \\nNontreponemal test antibody titers might correlate with disease \\nactivity and are used for monitoring treatment response. Serum \\nshould be diluted to identify the highest titer, and results should \\nbe reported quantitatively. A fourfold change in titer, equivalent \\nto a change of two dilutions (e.g., from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:8 \\nto 1:32), is considered necessary for demonstrating a clinically \\nsignificant difference between two nontreponemal test results \\nobtained by using the same serologic test, preferably from the \\nsame manufacturer to avoid variation in results. Sequential \\nserologic tests for a patient should be performed using the \\nsame testing method (VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same \\nlaboratory. VDRL and RPR are equally valid assays; however, \\nquantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared \\ndirectly with each other because the methods are different, \\nand RPR titers frequently are slightly higher than VDRL titers.\\n\\nNontreponemal test titers usually decrease after treatment \\nand might become nonreactive with time. However, for certain \\npersons, nontreponemal antibodies might decrease less than \\nfourfold after treatment (i.e., inadequate serologic response) \\nor might decline appropriately but fail to serorevert and \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n40 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\npersist for a long period. Atypical nontreponemal serologic \\ntest results (e.g., unusually high, unusually low, or fluctuating \\ntiters) might occur regardless of HIV status. When serologic \\ntests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of \\nprimary, secondary, or latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is \\nrecommended for persons with risk factors for syphilis, and use \\nof other tests (e.g., biopsy for histology and immunostaining \\nand PCR of lesion) should be considered. For the majority \\nof persons with HIV infection, serologic tests are accurate \\nand reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response \\nto treatment.\\n\\nTreponemal Tests and Reverse \\nSequence Algorithm\\n\\nThe majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests \\nwill have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless \\nof adequate treatment or disease activity. However, 15%–25% \\nof patients treated during the primary stage revert to being \\nserologically nonreactive after 2–3 years (570). Treponemal \\nantibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore \\nshould not be used for this purpose.\\n\\nClinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic \\nsamples by using automated treponemal immunoassays, \\ntypically by EIA or CIA (571–573). This reverse sequence \\nalgorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously \\ntreated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely \\ntreated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can \\noccur with a low likelihood of infection (574). Persons with \\na positive treponemal screening test should have a standard \\nquantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed \\nreflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management \\ndecisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory \\nshould perform a treponemal test different from the one used \\nfor initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based \\non different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the \\nresults of the initial test.\\n\\nIf a second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA reactive, \\nRPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history \\nof previous treatment will require no further management \\nunless sexual history indicates a reexposure. In this instance, a \\nrepeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical \\nhistory and physical examination is recommended to evaluate \\nfor early infection. Those without a history of treatment for \\nsyphilis should be offered treatment. Unless a medical history \\nor results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection, \\npreviously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of \\nunknown duration or late latent syphilis.\\n\\nIf the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA reactive, \\nRPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and the epidemiologic \\n\\nrisk and clinical probability for syphilis are low, further \\nevaluation or treatment is not indicated.\\n\\nMultiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index \\nvalues or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA \\nor CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might \\neliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; \\nhowever, the range of index values varies among different \\ntreponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to \\nhigh levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ \\nby immunoassay (567,575–582).\\n\\nCerebrospinal Fluid Evaluation\\nFurther testing with CSF evaluation is warranted for \\n\\npersons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis (e.g., cranial nerve \\ndysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental \\nstatus, or loss of vibration sense). All patients with ocular \\nsymptoms and reactive syphilis serology need a full ocular \\nexamination, including cranial nerve evaluation. If cranial nerve \\ndysfunction is present, a CSF evaluation is needed. Among \\npersons with isolated ocular symptoms (i.e., no cranial nerve \\ndysfunction or other neurologic abnormalities), confirmed \\nocular abnormalities on examination, and reactive syphilis \\nserology, a CSF examination is unnecessary before treatment. \\nCSF analysis can be helpful in evaluating persons with ocular \\nsymptoms and reactive syphilis serology who do not have ocular \\nfindings or cranial nerve dysfunction on examination. Among \\npatients with isolated auditory abnormalities and reactive \\nsyphilis serology, CSF evaluation is likely to be normal and is \\nunnecessary before treatment (583,584).\\n\\nLaboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of \\nneurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose \\nneurosyphilis in all instances. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis \\ndepends on a combination of CSF tests (e.g., CSF cell count, \\nprotein, or reactive CSF-VDRL) in the presence of reactive \\nserologic test (nontreponemal and treponemal) results and \\nneurologic signs and symptoms. CSF laboratory abnormalities \\nare common for persons with early syphilis and are of \\nunknown medical significance in the absence of neurologic \\nsigns or symptoms (585). CSF-VDRL is highly specific but \\ninsensitive. For a person with neurologic signs or symptoms, a \\nreactive CSF-VDRL (in the absence of blood contamination) \\nis considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis.\\n\\nWhen CSF-VDRL is negative despite clinical signs of \\nneurosyphilis, reactive serologic tests results, lymphocytic \\npleocytosis, or protein, neurosyphilis should be considered. \\nIn that instance, additional evaluation by using fluorescent \\ntreponemal-antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or TP-PA testing \\non CSF might be warranted. The CSF FTA-ABS test is less \\nspecific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly \\nsensitive. Fewer data are available regarding CSF TP-PA; \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 41US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nhowever, the sensitivity and specificity appear similar to the \\nCSF FTA-ABS (586). Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with \\na negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test, especially among \\npersons with nonspecific neurologic signs and symptoms (587).\\n\\nAmong persons with HIV infection, CSF leukocyte count \\ncan be elevated (>5 WBCs/mm3); the association with CSF \\nleukocyte count and plasma HIV viral suppression has not been \\nwell characterized. Using a higher cutoff (>20 WBCs/mm3) \\nmight improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis among \\nthis population (588).\\n\\nTreatment\\nPenicillin G, administered parenterally, is the preferred drug \\n\\nfor treating patients in all stages of syphilis. The preparation \\nused (i.e., benzathine, aqueous procaine, or aqueous \\ncrystalline), dosage, and length of treatment depend on the \\nstage and clinical manifestations of the disease. Treatment for \\nlate latent syphilis (>1 years’ duration) and tertiary syphilis \\nrequires a longer duration of therapy because organisms \\ntheoretically might be dividing more slowly (the validity of this \\nrationale has not been assessed). Longer treatment duration is \\nrequired for persons with latent syphilis of unknown duration \\nto ensure that those who did not acquire syphilis within the \\npreceding year are adequately treated.\\n\\nSelection of the appropriate penicillin preparation is \\nimportant because T. pallidum can reside in sequestered sites \\n(e.g., the CNS and aqueous humor) that are poorly accessed \\nby certain forms of penicillin. Combinations of benzathine \\npenicillin, procaine penicillin, and oral penicillin preparations \\nare not considered appropriate for syphilis treatment. Reports \\nhave indicated that practitioners have inadvertently prescribed \\ncombination long- and short-acting benzathine-procaine \\npenicillin (Bicillin C-R) instead of the standard benzathine \\npenicillin product (Bicillin L-A) recommended in the United \\nStates for treating primary, secondary, and latent syphilis. \\nPractitioners, pharmacists, and purchasing agents should be \\naware of the similar names of these two products to avoid \\nusing the incorrect combination therapy agent for treating \\nsyphilis (589).\\n\\nPenicillin’s effectiveness for treating syphilis was well \\nestablished through clinical experience even before the value of \\nrandomized controlled clinical trials was recognized. Therefore, \\napproximately all recommendations for treating syphilis are \\nbased not only on clinical trials and observational studies, but \\non many decades of clinical experience.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nParenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented \\n\\nefficacy for syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women with \\nsyphilis at any stage who report penicillin allergy should be \\ndesensitized and treated with penicillin (see Management of \\nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).\\n\\nJarisch-Herxheimer Reaction\\nThe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction \\n\\nfrequently accompanied by headache, myalgia, and fever that \\ncan occur within the first 24 hours after the initiation of any \\nsyphilis therapy; it is a reaction to treatment and not an allergic \\nreaction to penicillin. Patients should be informed about this \\npossible adverse reaction and how to manage it if it occurs. The \\nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs most frequently among \\npersons who have early syphilis, presumably because bacterial \\nloads are higher during these stages. Antipyretics can be used \\nto manage symptoms; however, they have not been proven to \\nprevent this reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction might \\ninduce early labor or cause fetal distress in pregnant women; \\nhowever, this should not prevent or delay therapy (590) (see \\nSyphilis During Pregnancy).\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSexual transmission of T. pallidum is thought to occur only \\n\\nwhen mucocutaneous syphilitic lesions are present. Such \\nmanifestations are uncommon after the first year of infection. \\nPersons exposed through sexual contact with a person who \\nhas primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis should be \\nevaluated clinically and serologically and treated according to \\nthe following recommendations:\\n\\n• Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who \\nreceives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent \\nsyphilis <90 days before the diagnosis should be treated \\npresumptively for early syphilis, even if serologic test results \\nare negative.\\n\\n• Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who \\nreceives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent \\nsyphilis >90 days before the diagnosis should be treated \\npresumptively for early syphilis if serologic test results are \\nnot immediately available and the opportunity for \\nfollow-up is uncertain. If serologic tests are negative, no \\ntreatment is needed. If serologic tests are positive, \\ntreatment should be based on clinical and serologic \\nevaluation and syphilis stage.\\n\\n• In certain areas or among populations with high syphilis \\ninfection rates, health departments recommend notification \\nand presumptive treatment of sex partners of persons with \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n42 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nsyphilis of unknown duration who have high nontreponemal \\nserologic test titers (i.e., >1:32) because high titers might \\nbe indicative of early syphilis.

However, \\nno comparative trials have been conducted to guide selection \\nof an optimal penicillin regimen. Substantially fewer data are \\navailable for nonpenicillin regimens.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Primary and Secondary Syphilis* \\nAmong Adults\\n\\nBenzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a single dose\\n\\n* Recommendations for treating syphilis among persons with HIV infection \\nand pregnant women are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Syphilis \\nAmong Persons with HIV Infection; Syphilis During Pregnancy).\\n\\nAvailable data demonstrate that use of additional doses of \\nbenzathine penicillin G, amoxicillin, or other antibiotics do \\nnot enhance efficacy of this recommended regimen when used \\nto treat primary and secondary syphilis, regardless of HIV \\nstatus (591–593).\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Syphilis Among Infants and \\nChildren \\n\\nBenzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM, up to the adult \\ndose of 2.4 million units in a single dose\\n\\nInfants and children aged ≥1 month who receive a syphilis \\ndiagnosis should have birth and maternal medical records \\nreviewed to assess whether they have congenital or acquired \\nsyphilis (see Congenital Syphilis). Infants and children aged \\n≥1 month with primary and secondary syphilis should be \\nmanaged by a pediatric infectious disease specialist and \\nevaluated for sexual abuse (e.g., through consultation with child \\nprotective services) (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAll persons who have primary and secondary syphilis should \\n\\nbe tested for HIV at the time of diagnosis and treatment. Those \\npersons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered \\nHIV PrEP. In geographic areas in which HIV prevalence is \\nhigh, persons who have primary or secondary syphilis should \\nbe offered PrEP and retested for HIV in 3 months if the initial \\nHIV test result was negative.\\n\\nPersons who have syphilis and symptoms or signs indicating \\nneurologic disease (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, \\nstroke, or altered mental state) should have an evaluation \\nthat includes CSF analysis. Persons with syphilis who have \\nsymptoms or signs of ocular syphilis (e.g., uveitis, iritis, \\nneuroretinitis, or optic neuritis) should have a thorough cranial \\nnerve examination and ocular slit-lamp and ophthalmologic \\nexaminations. CSF evaluation is not always needed for persons \\nwith ocular syphilis if no evidence of cranial nerves 2, 3, 4, \\n5, and 6 dysfunction or other evidence of neurologic disease \\nexists. If symptoms and signs of otic syphilis are present then \\nan otologic examination is needed; CSF evaluation in persons \\nwith otic syphilis does not aid in the clinical management \\nand therefore is not recommended (see Cerebrospinal Fluid \\nEvaluation). Treatment should be guided by the results of these \\nevaluations. Invasion of CSF by T. pallidum accompanied \\nby CSF laboratory abnormalities is common among adults \\nwho have primary or secondary syphilis but has unknown \\nmedical significance (585). In the absence of clinical \\nneurologic findings, no evidence supports variation from the \\nrecommended treatment regimen for primary or secondary \\nsyphilis. Symptomatic neurosyphilis after treatment with the \\npenicillin regimens recommended for primary and secondary \\nsyphilis is rare. Therefore, unless clinical signs or symptoms of \\nneurologic or ophthalmic involvement are present, routine CSF \\nanalysis is not recommended for persons who have primary or \\nsecondary syphilis.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nClinical and serologic evaluation should be performed at \\n\\n6 and 12 months after treatment; more frequent evaluation \\nmight be prudent if opportunity for follow-up is uncertain \\nor if repeat infection is a clinical concern. Serologic response \\n(i.e., titer) should be compared with the titer at the time of \\ntreatment. However, assessing serologic response to treatment \\ncan be difficult, and definitive criteria for cure or failure by \\nserologic criteria have not been well established. In addition, \\nnontreponemal test titers might decrease more slowly for \\npersons previously treated for syphilis (594,595).\\n\\nPersons who have signs or symptoms that persist or recur \\nand those with at least a fourfold increase in nontreponemal \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 43US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ntest titer persisting for >2 weeks likely were reinfected or \\nexperienced treatment failure.

These persons should also be reevaluated for \\nHIV infection.\\n\\nAmong persons with no neurologic findings after a thorough \\nneurologic examination and who are sexually active, reinfection \\nis likely and repeat treatment for early syphilis is recommended. \\nThese persons should also be reevaluated for HIV infection.\\n\\nFailure of nontreponemal test titers to decrease fourfold \\nwithin 12 months after therapy for primary or secondary \\nsyphilis (inadequate serologic response) might be indicative \\nof treatment failure. However, clinical trial data have \\ndemonstrated that 10%–20% of persons with primary and \\nsecondary syphilis treated with the recommended therapy \\nwill not achieve the fourfold decrease in nontreponemal titer \\nwithin 12 months after treatment (591,596,597). Serologic \\nresponse to treatment appears to be associated with multiple \\nfactors, including the person’s syphilis stage (earlier stages are \\nmore likely to decrease fourfold and become nonreactive), \\ninitial nontreponemal antibody titers (titers <1:8 are less likely \\nto decline fourfold than higher titers), and age (titers among \\nolder patients might be less likely to decrease fourfold than \\nthose of younger patients) (596–598). Optimal management \\nof persons who have an inadequate serologic response after \\nsyphilis treatment is unclear. At a minimum, these persons \\nshould receive additional neurologic examinations, clinical \\nand serologic follow-up annually, and reevaluation for HIV \\ninfection. If neurologic symptoms or signs are identified, \\na CSF evaluation is recommended, with findings guiding \\nmanagement. If additional follow-up cannot be ensured, \\nretreatment is recommended. Because treatment failure might \\nbe the result of unrecognized CNS infection, CSF examination \\ncan be considered in situations in which follow-up is uncertain.\\n\\nFor retreatment, weekly injections of benzathine penicillin \\nG 2.4 million units intramuscularly (IM) for 3 weeks is \\nrecommended, unless CSF examination indicates that \\nneurosyphilis is present (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, \\nand Otosyphilis). Serologic titers might not decrease, despite \\na negative CSF examination and a repeated 3-week therapy \\ncourse (599). In these circumstances, the benefit of additional \\ntherapy or repeated CSF examinations is unclear, and it is not \\ntypically recommended. Serologic and clinical monitoring at \\nleast annually should continue to monitor for any sustained \\nincreases in nontreponemal titer.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPenicillin Allergy\\nData to support use of alternatives to penicillin in treating \\n\\nprimary and secondary syphilis are limited. However, multiple \\ntherapies might be effective for nonpregnant persons with \\npenicillin allergy who have primary or secondary syphilis. \\nDoxycycline (100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days) (600,601) \\nand tetracycline (500 mg orally 4 times/day for 14 days) have \\nbeen used for years and can be effective. Compliance is likely to \\nbe better with doxycycline than tetracycline because tetracycline \\ncan cause more gastrointestinal side effects and requires more \\nfrequent dosing. Limited clinical studies, along with biologic \\nand pharmacologic evidence, indicate that ceftriaxone (1 g daily \\neither IM or IV for 10 days) is effective for treating primary \\nand secondary syphilis; however, the optimal dose and duration \\nof ceftriaxone therapy have not been defined (602,603). \\nAzithromycin as a single 2-g oral dose has been effective \\nfor treating primary and secondary syphilis among certain \\npopulations (602,604,605). However, because of T. pallidum \\nchromosomal mutations associated with azithromycin and \\nother macrolide resistance and documented treatment failures \\nin multiple U.S. geographic areas, azithromycin should not be \\nused as treatment for syphilis (606–608). Thorough clinical \\nand serologic follow-up of persons receiving any alternative \\ntherapy is essential.\\n\\nPersons with a penicillin allergy whose compliance with \\ntherapy or follow-up cannot be ensured should be desensitized \\nand treated with benzathine penicillin G. Skin testing for \\npenicillin allergy might be useful in circumstances in which \\nthe reagents and expertise are available for performing the test \\nadequately (see Management of Persons Who Have a History \\nof Penicillin Allergy).\\n\\nPregnancy\\nPregnant women with primary or secondary syphilis who \\n\\nare allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated \\nwith penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin dose \\nchallenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk for \\nacute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who Have \\na History of Penicillin Allergy; Syphilis During Pregnancy).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with HIV infection who have primary or secondary \\n\\nsyphilis should be treated similarly to those without HIV (see \\nSyphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection).\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n44 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nLatent Syphilis\\nLatent syphilis is defined as syphilis characterized by \\n\\nseroreactivity without other evidence of primary, secondary, \\nor tertiary disease. Persons who have latent syphilis and who \\nacquired syphilis during the preceding year are classified as \\nhaving early latent syphilis (early nonprimary, nonsecondary). \\nPersons can receive a diagnosis of early latent syphilis if, during \\nthe year preceding the diagnosis, they had a documented \\nseroconversion or a sustained (>2 weeks) fourfold or greater \\nincrease in nontreponemal test titers in a previously treated \\nperson; unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary \\nsyphilis; or a sex partner documented to have primary, \\nsecondary, or early latent syphilis. In addition, for persons \\nwith reactive nontreponemal and treponemal tests whose only \\npossible exposure occurred during the previous 12 months, \\nearly latent syphilis can be assumed.\\n\\nIn the absence of these conditions associated with latent \\nsyphilis, an asymptomatic person should be considered to \\nhave latent syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis \\n(>1 year’s duration). Nontreponemal serologic titers usually are \\nhigher early in the course of syphilis infection. However, early \\nlatent syphilis cannot be reliably diagnosed solely on the basis \\nof nontreponemal titers. All persons with latent syphilis should \\nhave careful examination of all accessible mucosal surfaces to \\nevaluate for mucosal lesions (primary or secondary syphilis) \\nbefore making a latent syphilis diagnosis. Physical examination \\nshould include the oral cavity, perianal area, perineum, rectum, \\nand genitals (vagina and cervix for women; scrotum, penis, and \\nunderneath the foreskin for uncircumcised men).\\n\\nTreatment\\nBecause latent syphilis is not transmitted sexually, the \\n\\nobjective of treating persons in this disease stage is to prevent \\nmedical complications of syphilis. Latent syphilis can also be \\nvertically transmitted to a fetus; therefore, the goal of treating \\na pregnant woman is to prevent congenital syphilis. Although \\nclinical experience supports the effectiveness of penicillin in \\nachieving this goal, limited evidence is available for guiding \\nchoice of specific regimens or duration. Available data \\ndemonstrate that additional doses of benzathine penicillin G, \\namoxicillin, or other antibiotics in early latent syphilis do not \\nenhance efficacy, regardless of HIV status (592,593,609).\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Latent Syphilis* Among Adults\\n\\nEarly latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a \\nsingle dose\\n\\nLate latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, \\nadministered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week intervals\\n\\n* Recommendations for treating syphilis in persons with HIV and pregnant \\nwomen are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Syphilis Among \\nPersons with HIV Infection; Syphilis During Pregnancy).\\n\\nInfants and children aged ≥1 month with diagnosed latent \\nsyphilis should be managed by a pediatric infectious disease \\nspecialist and receive a CSF examination. In addition, birth \\nand maternal medical records should be reviewed to assess \\nwhether these infants and children have congenital or acquired \\nsyphilis. For those with congenital syphilis, treatment should \\nbe undertaken as described (see Congenital Syphilis). Those \\nwith acquired syphilis should be evaluated for sexual abuse \\n(e.g., through consultation with child protection services) (see \\nSexual Assault or Abuse of Children). These regimens are for \\nchildren who are not allergic to penicillin who have acquired \\nsyphilis and who have normal CSF examinations.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAll persons who have latent syphilis should be tested for HIV \\n\\nat the time of diagnosis or treatment. Those persons whose \\nHIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP. In \\ngeographic areas in which the prevalence of HIV infection is \\nhigh or among populations vulnerable to HIV acquisition, \\npersons who have early latent or late latent syphilis should be \\noffered PrEP and retested for HIV in 3 months if the first HIV \\ntest result was negative.\\n\\nPersons who receive a diagnosis of latent syphilis and have \\nneurologic or ocular signs and symptoms (e.g., cognitive \\ndysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, ophthalmic or auditory \\nsymptoms, cranial nerve palsies, or symptoms or signs of \\nmeningitis or stroke) should be evaluated for neurosyphilis, ocular \\nsyphilis, or otosyphilis according to their clinical presentation \\n(see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis).\\n\\nIf a person receives a delayed dose of penicillin in a course of \\nweekly therapy for late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown \\nduration, the course of action that should be recommended \\nis unclear. Clinical experience indicates that an interval of \\n10–14 days between doses of benzathine penicillin for latent \\nsyphilis might be acceptable before restarting the sequence of \\ninjections (i.e., if dose 1 is administered on day 0, dose 2 is \\nadministered on days 10–14). Pharmacologic considerations \\nindicate that an interval of 7–9 days between doses, if feasible, \\nmight be preferred (610–612). Delayed doses are not optimal \\nfor pregnant women receiving therapy for latent syphilis (613). \\nPregnant women who have delays in any therapy dose >9 days \\nbetween doses should repeat the full course of therapy.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nQuantitative nontreponemal serologic tests should be \\n\\nrepeated at 6, 12, and 24 months. These serologic titers should \\nbe compared with the titer at the time of treatment.

All persons with ocular symptoms and reactive \\n\\nsyphilis serology need a full ocular examination, including \\ncranial nerve evaluation. If cranial nerve dysfunction is present, \\na CSF evaluation is needed. Among persons with isolated ocular \\nsymptoms (no cranial nerve dysfunction or other neurologic \\nabnormalities), reactive syphilis serology, and confirmed ocular \\nabnormalities on examination, CSF examination is unnecessary \\nbefore treatment. CSF analysis might be helpful in evaluating \\npersons with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology \\nwho do not have ocular findings on examination.

However, \\namong persons with isolated auditory symptoms, normal \\nneurologic examination, and reactive syphilis serology, CSF \\nexamination is likely to be normal and is not recommended \\nbefore treatment.

Therefore, repeated CSF examinations \\nare unnecessary for persons without HIV infection or persons \\nwith HIV infection who are on ART and who exhibit serologic \\nand clinical responses after treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPenicillin Allergy\\nLimited data indicate that ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily either IM \\n\\nor IV for 10–14 days can be used as an alternative treatment \\nfor persons with neurosyphilis (603,616,617). Cross-sensitivity \\nbetween ceftriaxone and penicillin can occur; however, the \\nrisk for penicillin cross-reactivity between third-generation \\ncephalosporins is negligible (618–621) (see Management of \\nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). If concern \\nexists regarding ceftriaxone safety for a patient with neurosyphilis, \\nskin testing should be performed to confirm penicillin allergy \\nand, if necessary, penicillin desensitization in consultation with \\na specialist is recommended. Other regimens have not been \\nadequately evaluated for treatment of neurosyphilis.\\n\\nPregnancy\\nPregnant women who are allergic to penicillin should be \\n\\ndesensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral \\ngraded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying \\nwomen at risk for acute allergic reactions (see Management of \\nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with HIV infection who have neurosyphilis should \\n\\nbe treated as described for persons without HIV (see Syphilis \\nAmong Persons with HIV Infection).\\n\\nSyphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\n\\nInterpretation of treponemal and nontreponemal serologic \\ntests for persons with HIV infection is the same as for persons \\nwithout HIV. Although rare, unusual serologic responses have \\n\\nbeen observed among persons with HIV infection who have \\nsyphilis. The majority of reports have involved posttreatment \\nserologic titers that were higher than expected (i.e., high serofast) \\nor fluctuated, and false-negative serologic test results and delayed \\nappearance of seroreactivity have also been reported (622).\\n\\nWhen clinical findings are indicative of syphilis, but serologic \\ntests are nonreactive or their interpretation is unclear, alternative \\ntests (e.g., biopsy of a lesion, darkfield examination, or PCR of \\nlesion material) might be useful for diagnosis. Neurosyphilis, \\nocular syphilis, and otosyphilis should be considered in the \\ndifferential diagnosis of neurologic, ocular, and other signs \\nand symptoms among persons with HIV infection.\\n\\nTreatment\\nPersons with HIV infection who have early syphilis might \\n\\nbe at increased risk for neurologic complications (623) and \\nmight have higher rates of inadequate serologic response \\nwith recommended regimens. The magnitude of these risks is \\nnot defined precisely but is likely small. Although long-term \\n(>1 year) comparative data are lacking, no treatment regimens \\nfor syphilis have been demonstrated to be more effective in \\npreventing neurosyphilis among persons with HIV infection \\nthan the syphilis regimens recommended for persons without \\nHIV (609). Careful follow-up after therapy is essential. Using \\nART per current HIV guidelines might improve clinical \\noutcomes among persons coinfected with HIV and syphilis; \\nconcerns regarding adequate treatment of syphilis among \\npersons with HIV infection might not apply to those with \\nHIV virologic suppression (624,625).\\n\\nPrimary and Secondary Syphilis Among Persons \\nwith HIV Infection\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Primary and Secondary Syphilis \\nAmong Persons with HIV Infection\\n\\nBenzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a single dose\\n\\nAvailable data demonstrate that additional doses of \\nbenzathine penicillin G, amoxicillin, or other antibiotics in \\nprimary and secondary syphilis among persons with HIV \\ninfection do not result in enhanced efficacy (592,593,609).\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nThe majority of persons with HIV infection respond \\n\\nappropriately to the recommended benzathine penicillin G \\ntreatment regimen for primary and secondary syphilis (626). \\nCSF abnormalities (e.g., mononuclear pleocytosis and elevated \\nprotein levels) can be common among persons with HIV, even \\nthose without syphilis.

Certain studies have demonstrated that among \\npersons with HIV infection and syphilis, CSF abnormalities \\nare associated with a CD4+ T-cell count of ≤350 cells/mL or \\nan RPR titer of ≥1:32 (614,627). However, CSF examination \\nfollowed by treatment for neurosyphilis on the basis of \\nlaboratory abnormalities has not been associated with improved \\nclinical outcomes in the absence of neurologic signs and \\nsymptoms. All persons with HIV infection and primary and \\nsecondary syphilis should have a thorough neurologic, ocular, \\nand otic examination (614,622,625). CSF examination should \\nbe reserved for those with an abnormal neurologic examination.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nPersons with HIV infection and primary or secondary \\n\\nsyphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically for \\npossible treatment failure at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after \\ntherapy; those who meet the criteria for treatment failure \\n(i.e., signs or symptoms that persist or recur or a sustained \\n[>2 weeks] fourfold or greater increase in titer) should be \\nmanaged in the same manner as persons without HIV infection \\n(i.e., depending on history of sexual activity and on findings of \\nneurologic examination, either repeat treatment with weekly \\ninjections of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for \\n3 weeks or CSF examination and repeat treatment guided by \\nCSF findings) (see Primary and Secondary Syphilis). \\n\\nIn addition, CSF examination and retreatment can be \\nconsidered for persons whose nontreponemal test titers do \\nnot decrease fourfold within 24 months of therapy. If CSF \\nexamination is normal, treatment with benzathine penicillin \\nG administered as 2.4 million units IM at weekly intervals for \\n3 weeks is recommended.

Patients with \\npenicillin allergy whose compliance with alternative therapy \\nor follow-up cannot be ensured should be desensitized and \\ntreated with penicillin G (see Management of Persons Who \\nHave a History of Penicillin Allergy).\\n\\nNeurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otic Syphilis \\nAmong Persons with HIV Infection\\n\\nAll persons with HIV and syphilis infection should receive a \\ncareful neurologic ocular and otic examination. Persons with \\nHIV infection and neurosyphilis should be treated according \\nto the recommendations for persons with neurosyphilis and \\nwithout HIV infection (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, \\nand Otosyphilis).\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nPersons with HIV and neurosyphilis infection should be \\n\\nmanaged according to the recommendations for persons without \\nHIV infection. Serum RPR can be followed for necessary \\ntreatment success rather than following CSF parameters (see \\nNeurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Limited data \\nindicate that changes in CSF parameters might occur more \\nslowly among persons with HIV infection, especially those \\nwith more advanced immunosuppression (588,624).\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPenicillin Allergy\\nPersons with HIV who are allergic to penicillin and have \\n\\nneurosyphilis infection should be managed according to the \\n\\nrecommendations for persons without HIV infection with \\nneurosyphilis who are allergic to penicillin (see Neurosyphilis, \\nOcular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Small observational studies \\nconducted among persons with HIV and neurosyphilis report \\nthat ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily for 10–14 days might be \\neffective as an alternative agent (628–630). The possibility \\nof cross-sensitivity between ceftriaxone and penicillin exists; \\nhowever, the risk for penicillin cross-reactivity between \\nthird-generation cephalosporins is negligible (619–621,631) \\n(see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin \\nAllergy). If concern exists regarding the safety of ceftriaxone \\nfor a person with HIV and neurosyphilis, skin testing should \\nbe performed to confirm penicillin allergy and, if necessary, \\npenicillin desensitization in consultation with a specialist is \\nrecommended. Other regimens have not been adequately \\nevaluated for treatment of neurosyphilis.\\n\\nSyphilis During Pregnancy\\nAll women should be screened serologically for syphilis \\n\\nat the first prenatal care visit (174), which is mandated by \\nthe majority of states (142). Among populations for whom \\nreceipt of prenatal care is not optimal, serologic screening and \\ntreatment (if serologic test is reactive) should be performed at \\nthe time of pregnancy testing (632). Antepartum screening can \\nbe performed by manual nontreponemal antibody testing (e.g., \\nRPR) by using the traditional syphilis screening algorithm or \\nby treponemal antibody testing (e.g., immunoassays) using the \\nreverse sequence algorithm.\\n\\nPregnant women with positive treponemal screening tests \\n(e.g., EIA, CIA, or immunoblot) should have additional \\nquantitative nontreponemal testing because titers are essential \\nfor monitoring treatment response. Serologic testing should \\nalso be performed twice during the third trimester: at 28 weeks’ \\ngestation and at delivery for pregnant women who live in \\ncommunities with high rates of syphilis and for women who \\nhave been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy.\\n\\nMaternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include \\nsex with multiple partners, sex in conjunction with drug \\nuse or transactional sex, late entry to prenatal care (i.e., first \\nvisit during the second trimester or later) or no prenatal \\ncare, methamphetamine or heroine use, incarceration of the \\nwoman or her partner, and unstable housing or homelessness \\n(174,633–636). Moreover, as part of the management of \\npregnant women who have syphilis, providers should obtain \\ninformation concerning ongoing risk behaviors and treatment \\nof sex partners to assess the risk for reinfection.\\n\\nAny woman who has a fetal death after 20 weeks’ gestation \\nshould be tested for syphilis. No mother or neonate should \\nleave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n50 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ndocumented at least once during pregnancy. Any woman who at \\nthe time of delivery has no prenatal care history or has been at \\nrisk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs; \\nhas had another STI during pregnancy; or has had multiple sex \\npartners, a new partner, or a partner with an STI) should have the \\nresults of a syphilis serologic test documented before discharge.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nPregnant women seropositive for syphilis should be \\n\\nconsidered infected unless an adequate treatment history is \\nclearly documented in the medical records and sequential \\nserologic antibody titers have decreased as recommended for \\nthe syphilis stage. The risk for antepartum fetal infection or \\ncongenital syphilis at delivery is related to the syphilis stage \\nduring pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring during \\nthe primary and secondary stages. Quantitative maternal \\nnontreponemal titer, especially if >1:8, might be a marker of \\nearly infection and bacteremia. However, risk for fetal infection \\nis still substantial among pregnant women with late latent \\nsyphilis and low titers. Pregnant women with stable, serofast \\nlow nontreponemal titers who have previously been treated \\nfor syphilis might not require additional treatment; however, \\nincreasing or high antibody titers in a pregnant woman \\npreviously treated might indicate reinfection or treatment \\nfailure, and treatment should be offered.\\n\\nIf an automated treponemal test (e.g., EIA or CIA) is used for \\nantepartum syphilis screening, all positive tests should be reflexed \\nto a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g., RPR or VDRL). If \\nthe nontreponemal test is negative, the results are considered \\ndiscrepant and a second treponemal test (TP-PA is preferred) \\nshould be performed, preferably on the same specimen.\\n\\nIf the second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA positive, \\nRPR negative, or TP-PA positive), current or previous syphilis \\ninfection can be confirmed. For women with a history of \\nadequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no \\nfurther treatment is necessary. Women without a history of \\ntreatment should have the syphilis stage determined and should \\nbe treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen.\\n\\nIf the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA positive, \\nRPR negative, or TP-PA negative), the positive EIA or CIA is \\nmore likely to represent a false-positive test result for women \\nwho are living in communities with low rates of syphilis, have \\na partner who is uninfected, and have no history of treated \\nsyphilis (637,638). If the woman is at low risk for syphilis, \\nlacks signs or symptoms of primary syphilis, has a partner \\nwith no clinical or serologic evidence of syphilis, and is likely \\nto follow up with clinical care, repeat serologic testing within 4 \\nweeks can be considered to determine whether the EIA or CIA \\nremains positive or if the RPR, VDRL, or TP-PA result becomes \\npositive. If both the RPR and TP-PA remain negative, no further \\n\\ntreatment is necessary. If follow-up is not likely, women with an \\nisolated reactive treponemal test and without a history of treated \\nsyphilis should be treated according to the syphilis stage.\\n\\nTreatment\\nPenicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for \\n\\ntreating fetal infection and preventing congenital syphilis \\n(639). Evidence is insufficient to determine the optimal \\npenicillin regimen during pregnancy (640).\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Syphilis During Pregnancy\\n\\nPregnant women should be treated with the recommended penicillin \\nregimen for their stage of infection\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nThe following recommendations should be considered for \\n\\npregnant women with syphilis infection:\\n• Certain evidence indicates that additional therapy is \\n\\nbeneficial for pregnant women to prevent congenital \\nsyphilis. For women who have primary, secondary, or early \\nlatent syphilis, a second dose of benzathine penicillin G \\n2.4 million units IM can be administered 1 week after the \\ninitial dose (641–643).\\n\\n• When syphilis is diagnosed during the second half of \\npregnancy, management should include a sonographic fetal \\nevaluation for congenital syphilis. However, this evaluation \\nshould not delay therapy. Sonographic signs of fetal or \\nplacental syphilis (e.g., hepatomegaly, ascites, hydrops, fetal \\nanemia, or a thickened placenta) indicate a greater risk for \\nfetal treatment failure (644); cases accompanied by these \\nsigns should be managed in consultation with obstetric \\nspecialists. A second dose of benzathine penicillin G \\n2.4 million units IM after the initial dose might be beneficial \\nfor fetal treatment in these situations.\\n\\n• Women treated for syphilis during the second half of \\npregnancy are at risk for premature labor or fetal distress \\nif the treatment precipitates the Jarisch-Herxheimer \\nreaction (590). These women should be advised to seek \\nobstetric attention after treatment if they notice any fever, \\ncontractions, or decrease in fetal movements. Stillbirth is \\na rare complication of treatment; however, concern for \\nthis complication should not delay necessary treatment. \\nNo data are available to support that corticosteroid \\ntreatment alters the risk for treatment-related complications \\nduring pregnancy.\\n\\n• Missed doses >9 days between doses are not acceptable for \\npregnant women receiving therapy for late latent syphilis \\n(613). An optimal interval between doses is 7 days for \\npregnant women. If a pregnant woman does not return \\nfor the next dose on day 7, every effort should be made \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 51US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nto contact her and link her to immediate treatment within \\n2 days to avoid retreatment. Pregnant women who miss a \\ndose of therapy should repeat the full course of therapy.\\n\\n• All women who have syphilis should be offered testing for \\nHIV at the time of diagnosis.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nCoordinated prenatal care and treatment are vital because \\n\\nproviders should document that women are adequately \\ntreated for the syphilis stage and ensure that the clinical and \\nantibody responses are appropriate for the patient’s disease \\nstage. If syphilis is diagnosed and treated at or before 24 weeks’ \\ngestation, serologic titers should not be repeated before 8 weeks \\nafter treatment (e.g., at 32 weeks’ gestation) but should be \\nrepeated again at delivery. Titers should be repeated sooner \\nif reinfection or treatment failure is suspected. For syphilis \\ndiagnosed and treated after 24 weeks’ gestation, serologic titers \\nshould be repeated at delivery.\\n\\nA majority of women will not achieve a fourfold decrease \\nin titers before delivery, although this does not indicate \\ntreatment failure (645). However, a fourfold increase in titer \\nafter treatment (e.g., from 1:8 to 1:32) that is sustained for \\n>2 weeks is concerning for reinfection or treatment failure. \\nNontreponemal titers can increase immediately after treatment, \\npresumably related to the treatment response. Therefore, unless \\nsymptoms and signs exist of primary or secondary syphilis, \\nfollow-up titer should not be repeated until approximately \\n8 weeks after treatment. Inadequate maternal treatment is \\nlikely if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy, clinical signs \\nof infection are present at delivery, or the maternal antibody \\ntiter at delivery is fourfold higher than the pretreatment titer.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPenicillin Allergy\\nNo proven alternatives to penicillin are available for \\n\\ntreatment of syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women who \\nhave a history of penicillin allergy should be desensitized and \\ntreated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin \\ndose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk \\nfor acute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who \\nHave a History of Penicillin Allergy).\\n\\nTetracycline and doxycycline are to be avoided in the second \\nand third trimesters of pregnancy (431). Erythromycin and \\nazithromycin should not be used because neither reliably cures \\nmaternal infection nor treats an infected fetus (640). Data are \\ninsufficient to recommend ceftriaxone or other cephalosporins \\n\\nfor treatment of maternal infection and prevention of \\ncongenital syphilis (646,647).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPlacental inflammation from congenital syphilis infection \\n\\nmight increase the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV. All \\nwomen with HIV infection should be evaluated for syphilis and \\nreceive a penicillin regimen appropriate for the syphilis stage. \\nData are insufficient to recommend any alternative regimens \\nfor pregnant women with syphilis and HIV infection (see \\nSyphilis Among Persons with HIV).\\n\\nCongenital Syphilis\\nThe rate of reported congenital syphilis in the United States \\n\\nhas increased dramatically since 2012. During 2019, a total of \\n1,870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported, including 94 \\nstillbirths and 34 infant deaths (141). The 2019 national rate \\nof 48.5 cases per 100,000 live births represents a 41% increase \\nrelative to 2018 (34.3 cases per 100,000 live births) and a 477% \\nincrease relative to 2012 (8.4 cases per 100,000 live births). \\nDuring 2015–2019, the rate of congenital syphilis increased \\n291.1% (12.4 to 48.5 per 100,000 live births), which mirrors \\nincreases in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis among \\nfemales aged 15–44 years (a 171.9% increase, from 3.2 to 8.7 \\nper 100,000 females).\\n\\nEffective prevention and detection of congenital syphilis \\ndepend on identifying syphilis among pregnant women and, \\ntherefore, on the routine serologic screening of pregnant \\nwomen during the first prenatal visit and at 28 weeks’ gestation \\nand at delivery for women who live in communities with high \\nrates of syphilis, women with HIV infection, or those who \\nare at increased risk for syphilis acquisition. Certain states \\nhave recommended screening three times during pregnancy \\nfor all women; clinicians should screen according to their \\nstate’s guidelines.\\n\\nMaternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include \\nsex with multiple partners, sex in conjunction with drug \\nuse or transactional sex, late entry to prenatal care (i.e., first \\nvisit during the second trimester or later) or no prenatal \\ncare, methamphetamine or heroine use, incarceration of the \\nwoman or her partner, and unstable housing or homelessness \\n(174,633–636). Moreover, as part of the management of \\npregnant women who have syphilis, providers should obtain \\ninformation concerning ongoing risk behaviors and treatment \\nof sex partners to assess the risk for reinfection.\\n\\nRoutine screening of neonatal sera or umbilical cord blood \\nis not recommended because diagnosis at that time does not \\nprevent congenital syphilis in certain newborns. No mother \\nor newborn infant should leave the hospital without maternal \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n52 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nserologic status having been documented at least once during \\npregnancy. Any woman who had no prenatal care before \\ndelivery or is considered at increased risk for syphilis acquisition \\nduring pregnancy should have the results of a syphilis serologic \\ntest documented before she or her neonate is discharged. A \\nquantitative RPR is needed at the time of delivery to compare \\nwith the neonate’s nontreponemal test result. If a stat RPR \\nis unavailable and a rapid treponemal test is performed at \\ndelivery, the results should be confirmed by using standard \\nsyphilis serologic laboratory tests (e.g., RPR and treponemal \\ntest) and algorithms.\\n\\nEvaluation and Treatment of Neonates\\nDiagnosis of congenital syphilis can be difficult because \\n\\nmaternal nontreponemal and treponemal immunoglobulin G \\n(IgG) antibodies can be transferred through the placenta to the \\nfetus, complicating the interpretation of reactive serologic tests \\nfor syphilis among neonates (infants aged <30 days). Therefore, \\ntreatment decisions frequently must be made on the basis of \\nidentification of syphilis in the mother; adequacy of maternal \\ntreatment; presence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic \\nevidence of syphilis in the neonate; and comparison of maternal \\n(at delivery) and neonatal nontreponemal serologic titers (e.g., \\nRPR or VDRL) by using the same test, preferably conducted \\nby the same laboratory. Any neonate at risk for congenital \\nsyphilis should receive a full evaluation and testing for HIV.\\n\\nAll neonates born to mothers who have reactive nontreponemal \\nand treponemal test results should be evaluated with a \\nquantitative nontreponemal serologic test (RPR or VDRL) \\nperformed on the neonate’s serum because umbilical cord blood \\ncan become contaminated with maternal blood and yield a \\nfalse-positive result, and Wharton’s jelly within the umbilical \\ncord can yield a false-negative result. The nontreponemal \\ntest performed on the neonate should be the same type of \\nnontreponemal test performed on the mother.\\n\\nConducting a treponemal test (e.g., TP-PA, immunoassay-\\nEIA, CIA, or microbead immunoassay) on neonatal serum is \\nnot recommended because it is difficult to interpret, as passively \\ntransferred maternal antibodies can persist for >15 months. \\nCommercially available IgM tests are not recommended.\\n\\nAll neonates born to women who have reactive nontreponemal \\nserologic tests for syphilis at delivery should be examined \\nthoroughly for evidence of congenital syphilis (e.g., nonimmune \\nhydrops, conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia† or \\ncholestatic jaundice or cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, \\nrhinitis, skin rash, or pseudoparalysis of an extremity). \\nPathologic examination of the placenta or umbilical cord using \\nspecific staining (e.g., silver) or a T. pallidum PCR test using \\n\\n† Direct hyperbilirubinemia is direct bilirubin level >2 mg/dL (34 umol/L) or \\n20% of the total bilirubin level.\\n\\na CLIA-validated test should be considered; direct fluorescence \\nantibody (DFA-TP) reagents are unavailable (565). Darkfield \\nmicroscopic examination or PCR testing of suspicious lesions \\nor body fluids (e.g., bullous rash or nasal discharge) also should \\nbe performed. In addition to these tests, for stillborn infants, \\nskeletal survey demonstrating typical osseous lesions might aid \\nin the diagnosis of congenital syphilis because these \\nabnormalities are not detected on fetal ultrasound.\\n\\nThe following scenarios describe the recommended \\ncongenital syphilis evaluation and treatment of neonates born \\nto women who had reactive nontreponemal and treponemal \\nserologic tests for syphilis during pregnancy (e.g., RPR reactive, \\nTP-PA reactive or EIA reactive, RPR reactive) and have a \\nreactive nontreponemal test at delivery (e.g., RPR reactive). \\nMaternal history of infection with T. pallidum and treatment \\nfor syphilis should be considered when evaluating and treating \\nthe neonate for congenital syphilis in most scenarios, except \\nwhen congenital syphilis is proven or highly probable.\\n\\nScenario 1: Confirmed Proven or Highly Probable \\nCongenital Syphilis\\n\\nAny neonate with \\n• an abnormal physical examination that is consistent with \\n\\ncongenital syphilis; \\n• a serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer that is \\n\\nfourfold§ (or greater) higher than the mother’s titer at \\ndelivery (e.g., maternal titer = 1:2, neonatal titer ≥1:8 or \\nmaternal titer\\xa0=\\xa01:8, neonatal titer ≥1:32)¶; or\\n\\n• a positive darkfield test or PCR of placenta, cord, lesions, or \\nbody fluids or a positive silver stain of the placenta or cord.\\n\\nRecommended Evaluation\\n• CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein**\\n\\n § One dilution is within the test performance of nontreponemal tests and is not \\na significant change.\\n\\n ¶ The absence of a fourfold or greater titer for a neonate does not exclude \\ncongenital syphilis.\\n\\n ** Interpretation of CSF test results requires a nontraumatic lumbar puncture \\n(i.e., a CSF sample that is not contaminated with blood). CSF test results \\nobtained during the neonatal period can be difficult to interpret; normal values \\ndiffer by gestational age and are higher among preterm infants. Studies indicate \\nthat 95% of healthy neonates have values of ≤16–19 WBCs/mm3 or protein \\nlevels of ≤115–118 mg/dL on CSF examination.

All infants and children with congenital syphilis \\nshould be managed similarly, regardless of HIV status.\\n\\nManagement of Persons Who Have a \\nHistory of Penicillin Allergy\\n\\nPenicillin and other ß-lactam antibiotics have a crucial \\nrole in treating STIs. Penicillin is recommended for all \\nclinical stages of syphilis, and no proven alternatives exist for \\ntreating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis during \\npregnancy. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is \\nrecommended for gonorrhea treatment. For extragenital site \\ninfections, especially pharyngeal, failure rates of nonceftriaxone \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 57US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nregimens can be substantial. In most clinical settings, patients \\nwho report a penicillin allergy are not treated with ß-lactam \\nantimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and \\na concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often \\navoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin \\nallergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low (652–654).\\n\\nPrevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately \\n10% among the U.S. population and higher among hospital \\ninpatients and residents in health care–related facilities (655–\\n658). One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8.3% of \\npatients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic \\nallergy (659). Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the \\nmajority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate \\nthe medication (660). The prevalence of reported penicillin \\nallergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited \\ndata indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently \\nreported antibiotic allergies (661).\\n\\nPatients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin \\nand are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. \\nThe presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces \\nprescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin \\nallergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective \\ndrugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer \\nlength of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple \\nstudies have described that persons with reported penicillin or \\nanother ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-\\nsite infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \\ninfections, and higher medical care usage (653,662–664).\\n\\nThe overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is \\nsecondary to imprecise use of the term “allergy” by families \\nand clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between \\nimmunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, \\ndrug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can \\noccur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients \\nwith a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have \\nlost the sensitivity after 10 years (658). Thus, patients with \\nrecent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients \\nwith remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions \\nin the distant past might no longer be reactive.\\n\\nIn a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7.1% of \\nthe patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another \\nß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin \\nallergy (659). Moreover, in studies that have incorporated \\npenicillin skin testing and graded oral challenge among persons \\nwith reported penicillin allergy, the true rates of allergy are low, \\nranging from 1.5% to 6.1% (665–667). Studies in preoperative \\nsurgical patients with reported penicillin allergy, evaluated \\nfor cardiovascular surgery (668) or orthopedics (669), have \\nrates of skin test positivity <8.5%. However, when patients \\nwith high-risk penicillin allergy histories are excluded, 99% \\n\\nof patients could receive ß-lactams. In hospitalized patients \\nand other populations with comorbidities, the typical rates of \\nvalidated penicillin allergy among patients who report a history \\nof penicillin allergy are 2.5%–9.0% (670–673).\\n\\nCross-Reactivity with Cephalosporins\\nPenicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ß-lactam ring. \\n\\nThis structural similarity has led to considerable confusion \\nregarding cross-reactivity of these drugs and the risks for \\nallergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillin-\\nallergic patients. In most clinical settings, patients with \\nreported penicillin allergy are precluded from treatment \\nwith such cephalosporin antibiotics as ceftriaxone. Third-\\ngeneration cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and cefixime) have \\nlower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic \\npatients (<1%) compared with first- and second-generation \\ncephalosporins (range: 1%–8%). Moreover, anaphylaxis \\nsecondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons \\nwho report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate \\nof one per 52,000 persons (652). Data from the Kaiser health \\ncare system reported that among 3,313 patients with self-\\nreported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin \\n(mostly first generation), no cases of anaphylaxis were reported \\n(652). Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins \\nand carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of any \\nIgE-mediated symptoms (e.g., anaphylaxis or urticaria) from \\npenicillin during the preceding 10 years.\\n\\nValidating Penicillin or Another ß-Lactam \\nAntibiotic Allergy\\n\\nEvaluating a patient who reports a penicillin or another \\nß-lactam antibiotic allergy involves three steps: 1) obtaining \\na thorough medical history, including previous exposures to \\npenicillin or other ß-lactam antibiotics (658); 2) performing \\na skin test evaluation by using the penicillin major and minor \\ndeterminants; and 3) among those who have a negative \\npenicillin skin test, performing an observed oral challenge with \\n250 mg amoxicillin before proceeding directly to treatment \\nwith the indicated ß-lactam therapy (667,675).\\n\\nFor persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin \\n(either to the major or minor determinants), treatment with a \\nß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective \\nantimicrobials should be used (656,658). For persons among \\nwhom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic (e.g., a \\npatient with neurosyphilis or a pregnant woman with syphilis) \\nand among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction \\nof penicillin tolerance (also referred to as desensitization) is \\nrequired (675). Desensitization protocols to penicillin should \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n58 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nbe performed by allergists, and they require a monitored \\ninpatient environment.\\n\\nPenicillin Skin Testing\\nPenicillin skin testing with a major determinant \\n\\nanalog (penicilloyl-polylysine) and minor determinants \\n(benzylpenicilloate, benzylpenilloate, or benzylpenicillin \\nisomers of penicillin) are used for skin test evaluation for \\nIgE-dependent penicillin allergy and can reliably identify \\npersons at high risk for IgE-mediated reactions to penicillin \\n(658,660,676). Until recently, penicillin skin testing in the \\nUnited States only included the major determinant benzyl \\npenicillin poly-L-lysine (Pre-Pen) in addition to penicillin \\nG. This test identifies approximately 90%–99% of the IgE-\\nmediated penicillin-allergic patients. Because the remaining \\n1%–10% of penicillin-allergic patients who are not captured \\nby this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants IgE \\nantibodies, the standard practice is to follow skin testing with \\nan observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour \\nof observation. If the skin test and oral challenge are both \\nnegative, the risk for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis approaches zero \\nand is equivalent to that of a person who has never reported \\nan allergy to penicillin.\\n\\nA revised version of the penicillin skin test kit, which includes \\nthe major determinant reagent Pre-Pen, minor determinants, \\nand amoxicillin, is being evaluated by FDA. This penicillin \\nskin test kit has been evaluated among 455 patients (677) \\nwith previous allergy history and has a negative predictive \\nvalue of 98%. If approved, this kit might eliminate the need \\nfor oral challenge.\\n\\nPenicillin skin testing has become a clinically significant \\nelement in antibiotic stewardship programs, and the \\nprocedure has been increasingly used by hospital-based \\npharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians \\n(670,672,673,678,679) as part of overall antibiotic stewardship \\ninterventions. When integrated into stewardship, the rates of \\nß-lactam antibiotic use increased substantially (670).\\n\\nRecommendations\\nPersons with a history of severe adverse cutaneous \\n\\nreaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal \\nnecrolysis) and other severe non–IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., \\ninterstitial nephritis or hemolytic anemia) are not candidates \\nfor penicillin skin testing or challenge. Penicillin and any \\nother ß-lactam antibiotics should be avoided indefinitely \\namong these patients, who should be referred to an allergy \\ncenter for further evaluation. Similarly, patients who deny \\npenicillin allergy, but who report previous IgE-type reactions \\nto cephalosporins, should be referred to an allergist for specific \\ncephalosporin testing.\\n\\nIn a time of increasing antimicrobial resistance, following \\nrecommended use of antibiotic treatments is crucial. STI \\nprograms and clinicians should promote increased access to \\npenicillin allergy testing. Allergy testing is being provided by \\nclinicians in primary care and hospital settings. If appropriate, \\nSTI programs and ambulatory settings should consider \\ndeveloping expanded access to penicillin or ß-lactam allergy \\nassessment.\\n\\nPersons with high-risk symptom histories (e.g., anaphylaxis \\nwithin the previous 10 years) should not be administered \\npenicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting. \\nFurthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should \\nnot receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge \\nin an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an \\nallergist for further evaluation.\\n\\nHigh-risk symptom histories include development of \\nthe following after penicillin or ß-lactam administration: \\nanaphylaxis within 6 hours or severe adverse cutaneous reaction \\n(e.g., eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson \\nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or acute generalized \\nexanthematous pustulosis) and other severe non–IgE-mediated \\nreactions (e.g., kidney or hepatic injury, hemolytic anemia, or \\nthrombocytopenia).\\n\\nDirect Treatment Approach for Ceftriaxone\\nAmong persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin \\n\\nallergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation \\ncephalosporins is low (652,680,681). If a patient has a low-\\nrisk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory \\nsettings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins \\nwithout further testing. Low-risk history includes one \\nnonspecific symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, \\nheadache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash) (Box 2). In addition, \\na family history of penicillin or ß-lactam allergy alone is not a \\ncontraindication for treatment with ß-lactam antibiotics. This \\npractice is increasingly being used in ambulatory settings and \\nfor preoperative prophylaxis (658,663,680,682–684).\\n\\nBOX 2.

If the reaction \\noccurred in the distant past (>10 years), the likelihood is \\nreduced even further (653,658,663,682,683,685,686). The \\nrisk for severe amoxicillin-mediated anaphylaxis has decreased \\nover time and is rare. In the United Kingdom during 1972–\\n2007, one fatal case of amoxicillin-medicated anaphylaxis was \\nreported (684).\\n\\n Skin Testing for Penicillin Allergy\\nSkin testing for penicillin allergy should be performed if \\n\\nany indication exists that the symptoms were secondary to an \\nIgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Testing is also indicated as a \\npotential diagnostic procedure to definitively rule out penicillin \\nallergy and document a negative allergy status in the medical \\nrecord (i.e., delabeling). Because penicillin allergy testing \\ndoes not test for multiple minor determinants, a person with \\na negative skin test should follow up with an oral challenge to \\nconfirm the negative status.\\n\\nPersons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by \\nan amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin \\ntherapy safely if needed. Persons with positive skin test results and \\nfor whom no other clinical options exist (e.g., neurosyphilis and \\nsyphilis in a pregnant woman) should be referred to an allergist \\nand desensitized before initiating treatment.\\n\\nTesting Procedures\\nPenicillin skin testing includes use of skin test reagents for \\n\\nidentifying persons at risk for adverse reactions (Box 3), followed \\nby initial pinprick screening with penicillin major determinants \\n(Pre-Pen) and penicillin G, followed by intradermal testing if \\npinprick results are negative. Penicillin testing procedures are \\nperformed in accordance with the Pre-Pen test kit instructions \\n(https://penallergytest.com/wp-content/uploads/PRE-PEN-\\nPackage-Insert.pdf ). Saline negative controls and histamine \\npositive controls are an integral part of the procedure. Penicillin \\nskin testing should not be performed for patients who have \\ntaken antihistamines within the past 7 days.\\n\\nSkin testing can be safely performed by trained \\nnonallergists and has been implemented as an antimicrobial \\nstewardship intervention by internal medicine physicians, \\npharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians \\n(670,673,678,679). Patients tested should also receive \\ndocumentation of status, and the results should be entered in \\nthe medical record.\\n\\nPenicillin skin testing during pregnancy is considered safe. \\nFor pregnant persons who report a penicillin or ß-lactam \\nallergy, penicillin allergy is an important consideration in \\ntreating syphilis during pregnancy and the potential for group \\nB streptococcal infection and preoperative prophylaxis if a \\ncesarean delivery is required. However, oral challenges should \\nnot be performed unless in a setting where additional support \\nservices are available.\\n\\nManaging Persons Being Tested\\nPatients who have a positive skin test should not receive \\n\\nß-lactam drugs in the ambulatory setting and should be \\nreferred to an allergist or penicillin allergy expert for further \\nevaluation. The allergy testing results should be documented \\nin the medical record. Patients who test negative should be \\ninformed that their risk for anaphylaxis is extremely low and is \\nequivalent to a person who does not report an allergy history. If \\ntreatment with penicillin or ceftriaxone is indicated, it can be \\nadministered safely. Documentation of testing results should \\nbe provided to the patient.\\n\\nDesensitization\\nDesensitization is required for persons who have a \\n\\ndocumented penicillin allergy and for whom no therapeutic \\nalternatives exist (e.g., syphilis during pregnancy and persons \\nwith neurosyphilis). Modified protocols might be considered \\n\\nBOX 3.

Signs of \\nurethral discharge on examination can also be present among \\npersons without symptoms. Although N. gonorrhoeae and C. \\ntrachomatis are well established as clinically important infectious \\ncauses of urethritis, M. genitalium has been strongly associated \\nwith urethritis and, less commonly, prostatitis (691–697). If \\nPOC diagnostic tools (e.g., Gram, methylene blue [MB], or \\ngentian violet [GV] stain microscopy) are unavailable, drug \\nregimens effective against both gonorrhea and chlamydia \\nshould be administered. Further testing to determine the \\nspecific etiology is recommended for preventing complications, \\nreinfection, and transmission because a specific diagnosis might \\nimprove treatment compliance, delivery of risk-reduction \\ninterventions, and partner services. Both chlamydia and \\ngonorrhea are reportable to health departments. NAATs are \\npreferred for detecting C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, and \\nurine is the preferred specimen for males (553). NAAT-based \\ntests for diagnosing T. vaginalis among men with urethritis \\nhave not been cleared by FDA; however, laboratories have \\nperformed the CLIA-compliant validation studies (698) \\nneeded to provide such testing.\\n\\nEtiology\\nMultiple organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The \\n\\npresence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) \\nor purple intracellular diplococci (MB or GV) on urethral \\nsmear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, \\nwhich is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. \\nNongonococcal urethritis (NGU), which is diagnosed when \\nmicroscopy of urethral secretions indicate inflammation \\nwithout GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, \\nis caused by C. trachomatis in 15%–40% of cases; however, \\n\\nprevalence varies by age group, with a lower proportion of \\ndisease occurring among older men (699). Documentation \\nof chlamydial infection as NGU etiology is essential because \\nof the need for partner referral for evaluation and treatment \\nto prevent complications of chlamydia, especially for female \\npartners. Complications of C. trachomatis–associated NGU \\namong males include epididymitis, prostatitis, and reactive \\narthritis.\\n\\nM. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and \\nurethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU \\ncases in the United States (691–693,696,697,700). Among \\nmen with symptoms of urethritis, M. genitalium was detected \\nin 11% of those with urethritis in Australia (701), 12%–15% \\nin the United Kingdom (702–704), 15% in South Africa (696), \\n19% in China (705), 21% in Korea, 22% in Japan (706), and \\n28.7% in the United States (range: 20.4%–38.8%) (697). Data \\nare inconsistent regarding other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma \\nspecies as etiologic agents of urethritis (707). The majority \\nof men with Ureaplasma infections do not have overt disease \\nunless a high organism load is present.\\n\\nT. vaginalis can cause urethritis among heterosexual \\nmen; however, the prevalence varies substantially by U.S. \\ngeographic region, age, and sexual behavior and within specific \\npopulations. Studies among men with and without overt \\nurethritis in developed countries document relatively low \\nrates of T. vaginalis in the Netherlands (0.5%) (708), Japan \\n(1.3%) (706,709), the United States (2.4%) (710), and the \\nUnited Kingdom (3.6%) (703). Studies in other countries have \\ndocumented higher rates, such as in Croatia (8.2%) (711) and \\nZimbabwe (8.4%) (712), particularly among symptomatic \\npatients.\\n\\nNeisseria meningitidis can colonize mucosal surfaces and \\ncause urethritis (713). Urogenital N. meningitidis rates \\nand duration of carriage, prevalence of asymptomatic and \\nsymptomatic infection, and modes of transmission have \\nnot been systematically described; however, studies indicate \\nthat N. meningitidis can be transmitted through oral-\\npenile contact (i.e., fellatio) (714–716). N. meningitidis \\nhas similar colony morphology appearance on culture and \\ncannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram stain. \\nIdentification of N. meningitidis as the etiologic agent with \\npresumed gonococcal urethritis on the basis of Gram stain \\nbut negative NAAT for gonorrhea requires a confirmation \\nby culture. Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same \\nantimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis. Although \\nevidence is limited regarding the risk for sexual transmission or \\nrecurrent infections with meningococcal urethritis, treatment \\nof sex partners of patients with meningococcal urethritis with \\nthe same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal \\ninfection can be considered. No indication exists for treating \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 61US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\npersons with N. meningitidis identified in their oropharynx \\nwhen not also associated with symptomatic urethritis.\\n\\nIn other instances, NGU can be caused by HSV, Epstein-\\nBarr virus, and adenovirus (699) acquired by fellatio (i.e., oral-\\npenile contact). In a retrospective review of 80 cases of HSV \\nurethritis in Australia (717), the majority of infections were \\nassociated with HSV-1 with clinical findings of meatitis (62%), \\ngenital ulceration (37%), and dysuria (20%). Adenovirus can \\npresent with dysuria, meatal inflammation, and conjunctivitis \\n(718). Enteric bacteria have been identified as an uncommon \\ncause of NGU and might be associated with insertive anal \\nintercourse (699).\\n\\nOther bacterial pathogens have been implicated as potential \\ncauses of clinical urethritis, either in clustered case series or as \\nsporadic cases such as Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus \\nparainfluenzae (719–723). Haemophilus was identified in 12.6% \\nof cases among 413 men (mostly MSM reporting insertive oral \\nsex) (724), and high rates of azithromycin resistance (39.5%) \\nwere identified among Haemophilus urethritis patients (725). \\nIndividual case reports have linked NGU to multiple bacterial \\nspecies, including Corynebacterium propinquum (726), Kurthia \\ngibsonii (727), Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum (728,729), \\nCorynebacterium striatrium (730), Aerococcus urinae (731), \\nand Neisseria elongata (732). Diagnostic testing and treatment \\nfor less-common organisms are reserved for situations in \\nwhich these infections are suspected (e.g., sexual partner with \\ntrichomoniasis, urethral lesions, or severe dysuria and meatitis) \\nor when NGU is not responsive to recommended therapy.\\n\\nEven in settings that provide comprehensive diagnostic \\ntesting, etiology can remain obscure in half of cases. Idiopathic \\nNGU was reported in 772 (59%) of 1,295 first presentations \\nof NGU among men seeking sexual health services in Australia \\n(701). In a case-control study of 211 men with NGU \\nsymptoms in Denmark, no identifiable pathogen was identified \\nin 24% of acute cases and 33% of chronic cases (733). NGU’s \\nimportance if not caused by a defined pathogen is uncertain; \\nneither complications (e.g., urethral stricture or epididymitis) \\nnor adverse outcomes among sex partners have been identified \\nin these cases.\\n\\nAssociations between NGU and insertive anal and oral \\nexposure have been reported (734), as have higher rates \\nof BV-associated Leptotrichia or Sneathia species among \\nheterosexual men with urethritis (735). These studies increase \\nconcern for possible undetected infectious rectal or vaginal \\npathogens, or alternatively, a transient reactive dysbiosis after \\nexposure to a new microbiome or even a noninfectious reactive \\netiology (736).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nClinicians should attempt to obtain objective evidence of \\n\\nurethral inflammation. If POC diagnostic tests (e.g., Gram \\nstain or MB or GV microscopy) are unavailable, urethritis \\ncan be documented on the basis of any of the following signs \\nor laboratory tests:\\n\\n• Mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge on examination.\\n• Gram stain is a POC diagnostic test for evaluating \\n\\nurethritis that is highly sensitive and specific for \\ndocumenting both urethritis and the presence or absence \\nof gonococcal infection; MB or GV stain of urethral \\nsecretions is an alternative POC diagnostic test with \\nperformance characteristics similar to Gram stain; thus, \\nthe cutoff number for WBCs per oil immersion field \\nshould be the same (737).\\n\\n ű Presumed gonococcal infection is established by \\ndocumenting the presence of WBCs containing GNID \\nin Gram stain or intracellular purple diplococci in MB \\nor GV smears; men should be tested for C. trachomatis \\nand N. gonorrhoeae by NAATs and presumptively treated \\nand managed accordingly for gonococcal infection (see \\nGonococcal Infections).\\n\\n ű If no intracellular gram-negative or purple diplococci \\nare present, men should receive NAATs for C. trachomatis \\nand N. gonorrhoeae and can be managed for NGU as \\nrecommended (see Nongonococcal Urethritis).\\n\\n ű Gram stain of urethral secretions exist that demonstrate \\n≥2 WBCs per oil immersion field (738). The microscopy \\ndiagnostic cutoff might vary, depending on background \\nprevalence (≥2 WBCs/high power field [HPF] in high-\\nprevalence settings [STI clinics] or ≥5 WBCs/HPF in \\nlower-prevalence settings).§§\\n\\n§§ For urethral microscopy, the cutoff for diagnosing urethritis is ≥2 WBCs/HPF \\n(Sources: Rietmeijer CA, Mettenbrink CJ.

The diagnosis \\nof nongonococcal urethritis in men: can there be a universal standard? Sex \\nTransm Dis 2017;44:195–6). An additional evaluation supported this cutoff \\nby demonstrating NGU sensitivity of 92.6% for cutoff of ≥2 versus 55.6% \\nsensitivity for cutoff of ≥5 (Source: Sarier M, Sepin N, Duman I, et al. \\nMicroscopy of Gram-stained urethral smear in the diagnosis of urethritis: which \\nthreshold value should be selected?

Diagnostic \\ncutoffs for 369 symptomatic and asymptomatic heterosexual men seeking STI \\ncare in Seattle revealed a maximal sensitivity and specificity achieved with a \\ncutoff of ≥5 WBCs/HPF. Using a lower cutoff of ≥2 WBCs/HPF would miss \\n13% of C. trachomatis and M. genitalium and overtreat 45% of persons who \\nhave negative tests (Source: Leipertz G, Chambers L, Lowens S, et al.

Another study discussed that the WBC/HPF cutoff \\nvalue should discriminate on the basis of the prevalence of chlamydia, \\nmycoplasma, and gonorrhea among a clinic population (Source: Moi H, \\nHartgill U, Skullerud KH, Reponen EJ, Syvertsen L, Moghaddam A. \\nMicroscopy of stained urethral smear in male urethritis: which cutoff should \\nbe used?

Persons \\nwith chlamydia or gonorrhea should receive recommended \\ntreatment, and sex partners should be referred for evaluation \\nand treatment. If none of these clinical criteria are present, \\nempiric treatment of men with symptoms of urethritis is \\nrecommended only for those at high risk for infection who are \\nunlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation or test results. Such \\nmen should be treated with drug regimens effective against \\ngonorrhea and chlamydia.\\n\\nNongonococcal Urethritis\\nNGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have various \\n\\ninfectious etiologies. C. trachomatis has been well established \\nas an NGU etiology; however, prevalence varies across \\npopulations and accounts for <50% of overall cases (712,740–\\n742). M. genitalium is estimated to account for 10%–25% of \\ncases (696,697,701,703,704,706,733,743), and T. vaginalis \\nfor 1%–8% of cases depending on population and location \\n(703,706,708,710,712). Other etiologies include different \\nbacteria, such as Haemophilus species (724,725), N. meningitidis \\n(713,716), HSV (706,717), and adenovirus (744). However, \\neven when extensive testing is performed, no pathogens are \\nidentified in approximately half of cases (701,733).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nClinical presentation can include urethral discharge, \\n\\nirritation, dysuria, or meatal pruritus (697,743,745). NGU is \\nconfirmed for symptomatic men when diagnostic evaluation of \\nurethral secretions indicates inflammation, without evidence \\nof diplococci by Gram, MB, or GV smear on microscopy \\n(712,746,747). Visible discharge or secretions can be collected \\nby a swab without inserting it into the urethra; if no visible \\nsecretions, the swab can be inserted into the urethral meatus \\nand rotated, making contact with the urethral wall before \\nremoval. If microscopy is unavailable, urine testing for \\nleukocyte esterase can be performed on first-void urine, and \\nmicroscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void \\n\\nurine demonstrating ≥10 WBCs/HPF has a high negative \\npredictive value.\\n\\nAll men who have suspected or confirmed NGU should \\nbe tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea by using NAATs. \\nA specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, \\nreinfection, and transmission. M. genitalium testing should be \\nperformed for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms \\nafter initial empiric treatment. Testing for T. vaginalis should \\nbe considered in areas or among populations with high \\nprevalence, in cases where a partner is known to be infected, \\nor for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after \\ninitial empiric treatment.\\n\\nTreatment\\nIdeally, treatment should be pathogen based; however, \\n\\ndiagnostic information might not be immediately available. \\nPresumptive treatment should be initiated at NGU diagnosis. \\nDoxycycline is highly effective for chlamydial urethral \\ninfections and is also effective for chlamydial infections of \\nthe rectum; it also has some activity against M. genitalium. \\nIn contrast, reports have increased of azithromycin treatment \\nfailures for chlamydial infection (748,749), and the incidence \\nof macrolide resistance in M. genitalium also has been rapidly \\nrising (697,702,705,750,751). Pharmacokinetic data indicate \\nthat changing azithromycin dosing from a single-dose strategy \\nto a multiday strategy might protect against inducing resistance \\nin M. genitalium infections (745,752) (see Mycoplasma \\ngenitalium).\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Nongonococcal Urethritis\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\n\\nAlternative Regimens\\n\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose\\nor\\n\\nAzithromycin 500 mg orally in a single dose; then 250 mg orally daily \\nfor 4 days\\n\\nTo maximize compliance with recommended therapies, \\nmedications should be dispensed on-site at the clinic, and, \\nregardless of the number of doses involved in the regimen, \\nthe first dose should be directly observed. Erythromycin is no \\nlonger recommended for NGU because of its gastrointestinal \\nside effects and dosing frequency. Levofloxacin is no longer \\nrecommended for NGU because of its inferior efficacy, \\nespecially for M. genitalium.\\n\\nManagement Considerations\\nTo minimize transmission and reinfections, men treated for \\n\\nNGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse \\nuntil they and their partners have been treated (i.e., until \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 63US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ncompletion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved or \\nfor 7 days after single-dose therapy). Men with NGU should \\nbe tested for HIV and syphilis.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nMen should be provided their testing results obtained as \\n\\npart of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis \\nof chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be \\noffered partner services and instructed to return 3 months \\nafter treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of \\nreinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated \\n(136,137,753,754) (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal \\nInfections; Trichomoniasis).\\n\\nIf symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men \\nshould be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be \\ntested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis. Symptoms alone, \\nwithout documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of \\nurethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. \\nProviders should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic \\nprostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing \\npersistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; \\nvoiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or new-\\nonset premature ejaculation lasting for >3 months. Men with \\npersistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise \\nin pelvic pain disorders.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nAll sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding \\n\\n60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and \\npresumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against \\nchlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated \\naccording to the management section for their respective \\npathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is \\nunable to access timely care. To avoid reinfection, sex partners \\nshould abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their \\npartners are treated.\\n\\nPersistent or Recurrent Nongonococcal Urethritis\\nThe objective diagnosis of persistent or recurrent NGU \\n\\nshould be made before considering additional antimicrobial \\ntherapy. Symptomatic recurrent or persistent urethritis might \\nbe caused by treatment failure or reinfection after successful \\ntreatment. Among men who have persistent symptoms after \\ntreatment without objective signs of urethral inflammation, the \\nvalue of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been \\ndemonstrated. Treatment failure for chlamydial urethritis has \\nbeen estimated at 6%–12% (755). The most common cause \\nof persistent or recurrent NGU is M. genitalium, especially \\nafter doxycycline therapy (756,757). Treatment failure for \\nM. genitalium is harder to determine because certain men \\n\\nachieve clinical cure (i.e., resolution of symptoms) but can \\nstill have detectable M. genitalium in urethral specimens (758).\\n\\nThe initial step in recurrent urethritis is assessing compliance \\nwith treatment or potential reexposure to an untreated sex \\npartner (697,743). If the patient did not comply with the \\ntreatment regimen or was reexposed to an untreated partner, \\nretreatment with the initial regimen can be considered. If \\ntherapy was appropriately completed and no reexposure \\noccurred, therapy is dependent on the initial treatment \\nregimen. Ideally, diagnostic testing among men with recurrent \\nor persistent symptoms, including those with gonorrhea, \\nchlamydia, M. genitalium, and trichomoniasis, can be used to \\nguide further management decisions.\\n\\nT. vaginalis is also known to cause urethritis among men who \\nhave sex with women. In areas where T. vaginalis is prevalent, \\nmen who have sex with women with persistent or recurrent \\nurethritis should be tested for T. vaginalis and presumptively \\ntreated with metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose or \\ntinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose; their partners should be \\nreferred for evaluation and treatment, if needed.\\n\\nIf T. vaginalis is unlikely (MSM with NGU or negative \\nT. vaginalis NAAT), men with recurrent NGU should be tested \\nfor M. genitalium by using an FDA-cleared NAAT. Treatment \\nfor M. genitalium includes a two-stage approach, ideally using \\nresistance-guided therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is \\navailable it should be performed, and the results should be used \\nto guide therapy (see Mycoplasma genitalium). If M. genitalium \\nresistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally \\n2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally \\nonce daily for 7 days should be used. The rationale for this \\napproach is that although not curative, doxycycline decreases \\nthe M. genitalium bacterial load, thereby increasing likelihood \\nof moxifloxacin success (759). Higher doses of azithromycin \\nhave not been effective for M. genitalium after azithromycin \\ntreatment failures. Men with persistent or recurrent NGU after \\ntreatment for M. genitalium or T. vaginalis should be referred \\nto an infectious disease or urology specialist.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nNGU might facilitate HIV transmission (760). Persons with \\n\\nNGU and HIV infection should receive the same treatment \\nregimen as those who do not have HIV.\\n\\nCervicitis\\nTwo major diagnostic signs characterize cervicitis: 1) a \\n\\npurulent or mucopurulent endocervical exudate visible in \\nthe endocervical canal or on an endocervical swab specimen \\n(commonly referred to as mucopurulent cervicitis), and \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n64 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n2) sustained endocervical bleeding easily induced by gentle \\npassage of a cotton swab through the cervical os. Either or both \\nsigns might be present. Cervicitis frequently is asymptomatic; \\nhowever, certain women might report an abnormal vaginal \\ndischarge and intermenstrual vaginal bleeding (e.g., especially \\nafter sexual intercourse). The criterion of using an increased \\nnumber of WBCs on endocervical Gram stain in the diagnosis \\nof cervicitis has not been standardized; it is not sensitive, \\nhas a low positive predictive value for C. trachomatis and \\nN. gonorrhoeae infections, and is not available in most clinical \\nsettings (297,761). Leukorrhea, defined as >10 WBCs/HPF on \\nmicroscopic examination of vaginal fluid, might be a sensitive \\nindicator of cervical inflammation with a high negative \\npredictive value (i.e., cervicitis is unlikely in the absence of \\nleukorrhea) (762,763). Finally, although the presence of gram-\\nnegative intracellular diplococci on Gram stain of endocervical \\nexudate might be specific for diagnosing gonococcal cervical \\ninfection when evaluated by an experienced laboratorian, it is \\nnot a sensitive indicator of infection (764).\\n\\nEtiology\\nC. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology \\n\\nof cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. Trichomoniasis, \\ngenital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or \\nM. genitalium (761,765–768) also have been associated \\nwith cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no \\norganism is isolated, especially among women at relatively \\nlow risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g., women aged \\n>30 years) (769). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent \\ndouching might cause cervicitis (770–772). The majority \\nof persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection \\nwith C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might \\nbe involved (e.g., persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, \\nM. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical \\nirritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of \\nectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between \\ngroup B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis (773,774). \\nNo specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or \\nUreaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis (707,761,765,775,776).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nBecause cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract \\n\\ninfection (e.g., endometritis), women should be assessed for \\nsigns of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae \\nwith NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (553) (see \\nChlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women \\nwith cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV \\nand trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for \\ndetecting T. vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), \\nsymptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount \\n\\nmicroscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing \\n(i.e., NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) \\n(see Trichomoniasis). Testing for M. genitalium with the FDA-\\ncleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection \\nhas been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing \\n(i.e., PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. Testing for \\nU. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital \\nculture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.\\n\\nTreatment\\nMultiple factors should affect the decision to provide \\n\\npresumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with \\nantimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should \\nbe provided for women at increased risk (e.g., those aged \\n<25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner \\nwith concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if \\nfollow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not \\npossible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected \\n(see Bacterial Vaginosis; Trichomoniasis). For women at lower \\nrisk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic \\ntests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and \\nC. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a \\nfollow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved \\ncan be considered.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Cervicitis*\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\n\\n*  Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is \\nat risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of \\ngonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).\\n\\nAlternative Regimen\\n\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nTo minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated \\n\\nfor cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual \\nintercourse until they and their partners have been treated \\n(i.e., until completion of a 7-day regimen or for 7 days after \\nsingle-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved.

Women with a specific diagnosis of \\nchlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered \\npartner services and instructed to return in 3 months after \\ntreatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, \\nregardless of whether their sex partners were treated (753). If \\nsymptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to \\nreturn for reevaluation.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nManagement of sex partners of women treated for cervicitis \\n\\nshould be tailored for the specific infection identified or \\nsuspected. All sex partners during the previous 60 days should \\nbe referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment \\nif chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis was identified. EPT \\nand other effective partner referral strategies are alternative \\napproaches for treating male partners of women who have \\nchlamydial or gonococcal infection (125–127) (see Partner \\nServices). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain \\nfrom sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.\\n\\nPersistent or Recurrent Cervicitis\\nWomen with persistent or recurrent cervicitis despite \\n\\nantimicrobial therapy should be reevaluated for possible \\nreexposure or treatment failure. If relapse or reinfection with \\na specific infection has been excluded, BV is not present, and \\nsex partners have been evaluated and treated, management \\noptions for persistent cervicitis are undefined. In addition, \\nthe usefulness of repeated or prolonged administration of \\nantimicrobial therapy for persistent symptomatic cervicitis \\nremains unknown. The etiology of persistent cervicitis, \\nincluding the potential role of M. genitalium (777), is unclear. \\nM. genitalium might be considered for cases of cervicitis that \\npersist after azithromycin or doxycycline therapy in which \\nreexposure to an infected partner or medical nonadherence is \\nunlikely. Among women with persistent cervicitis who were \\npreviously treated with doxycycline or azithromycin, testing \\nfor M. genitalium can be considered and treatment initiated on \\nthe basis of results of diagnostic testing (318) (see Mycoplasma \\ngenitalium). For women with persistent symptoms that are \\nclearly attributable to cervicitis, referral to a gynecologic \\nspecialist can be considered for evaluation of noninfectious \\ncauses (e.g., cervical dysplasia or polyps) (778).\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nWomen with cervicitis and HIV infection should receive \\n\\nthe same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV. \\nCervicitis can increase cervical HIV shedding, and treatment \\n\\nreduces HIV shedding from the cervix and thereby might \\nreduce HIV transmission to susceptible sex partners (779–783).\\n\\nPregnancy\\nDiagnosis and treatment of cervicitis for pregnant women \\n\\ndoes not differ from that for women who are not pregnant (see \\nDiagnostic Considerations; Treatment).\\n\\nContraceptive Management\\nAccording to U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive \\n\\nUse, 2016, leaving an IUD in place during treatment for \\ncervicitis is advisable (58). However, current recommendations \\nspecify that an IUD should not be placed if active cervicitis \\nis diagnosed (59).\\n\\nChlamydial Infections\\nChlamydial Infection Among \\n\\nAdolescents and Adults\\nChlamydial infection is the most frequently reported \\n\\nbacterial infectious disease in the United States, and prevalence \\nis highest among persons aged ≤24 years (141,784). Multiple \\nsequelae can result from C. trachomatis infection among \\nwomen, the most serious of which include PID, ectopic \\npregnancy, and infertility. Certain women who receive a \\ndiagnosis of uncomplicated cervical infection already have \\nsubclinical upper genital tract infection.\\n\\nAsymptomatic infection is common among both men and \\nwomen. To detect chlamydial infection, health care providers \\nfrequently rely on screening tests. Annual screening of all \\nsexually active women aged <25 years is recommended, as is \\nscreening of older women at increased risk for infection (e.g., \\nwomen aged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more \\nthan one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, \\nor a sex partner who has an STI) (149). In a community-\\nbased cohort of female college students, incident chlamydial \\ninfection was also associated with BV and high-risk HPV \\ninfection (785). Although chlamydia incidence might be higher \\namong certain women aged ≥25 years in certain communities, \\noverall, the largest proportion of infection is among women \\naged <25 years (141).\\n\\nChlamydia screening programs have been demonstrated \\nto reduce PID rates among women (786,787). Although \\nevidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for \\nC. trachomatis among sexually active young men because of \\ncertain factors (i.e., feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness), \\nscreening of sexually active young men should be considered \\nin clinical settings with a high prevalence of chlamydia (e.g., \\nadolescent clinics, correctional facilities, or STD specialty \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n66 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nclinics) or for populations with a high burden of infection \\n(e.g., MSM) (149,788). Among women, the primary focus of \\nchlamydia screening should be to detect and treat chlamydia, \\nprevent complications, and test and treat their partners, \\nwhereas targeted chlamydia screening for men should be \\nconsidered only when resources permit, prevalence is high, and \\nsuch screening does not hinder chlamydia screening efforts for \\nwomen (789–791). More frequent screening than annual for \\ncertain women (e.g., adolescents) or certain men (e.g., MSM) \\nmight be indicated on the basis of risk behaviors.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nFor women, C. trachomatis urogenital infection can be \\n\\ndiagnosed by vaginal or cervical swabs or first-void urine. For \\nmen, C. trachomatis urethral infection can be diagnosed by \\ntesting first-void urine or a urethral swab. NAATs are the most \\nsensitive tests for these specimens and are the recommended \\ntest for detecting C. trachomatis infection (553). NAATs that \\nare FDA cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be \\ncollected by a clinician or patient in a clinical setting. Patient-\\ncollected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity \\nand specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs \\n(792,793), and this screening strategy is highly acceptable \\namong women (794,795). Optimal urogenital specimen \\ntypes for chlamydia screening by using NAAT include first-\\ncatch urine (for men) and vaginal swabs (for women) (553). \\nRecent studies have demonstrated that among men, NAAT \\nperformance on self-collected meatal swabs is comparable \\nto patient-collected urine or provider-collected urethral \\nswabs (796–798). Patient collection of a meatal swab for \\nC. trachomatis testing might be a reasonable approach for men \\nwho are either unable to provide urine or prefer to collect their \\nown meatal swab over providing urine. Previous evidence \\nindicates that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for \\nPap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT, although \\ntest sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than that \\nassociated with use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens (799); \\nregardless, certain NAATs have been cleared by FDA for use \\non liquid-based cytology specimens.\\n\\nRectal and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection among \\npersons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be \\ndiagnosed by testing at the anatomic exposure site. NAATs have \\nbeen demonstrated to have improved sensitivity and specificity, \\ncompared with culture, for detecting C. trachomatis at rectal \\nand oropharyngeal sites (553,800–804), and certain NAAT \\nplatforms have been cleared by FDA for these anatomic sites \\n(805). Data indicate that NAAT performance on self-collected \\nrectal swabs is comparable to clinician-collected rectal swabs, \\nand this specimen collection strategy for rectal C. trachomatis \\nscreening is highly acceptable among men (217,806). \\n\\nSelf-collected rectal swabs are a reasonable alternative to \\nclinician-collected rectal swabs for C. trachomatis screening by \\nNAAT, especially when clinicians are not available or when self-\\ncollection is preferred over clinician collection. Annual screening \\nfor rectal C. trachomatis infection should be performed among \\nmen who report sexual activity at the rectal site. Extragenital \\nchlamydial testing at the rectal site can be considered for \\nfemales on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and exposure \\nthrough shared clinical decision-making bythe patient and the \\nprovider. The majority of persons with C. trachomatis detected \\nat oropharyngeal sites do not have oropharyngeal symptoms. \\nThe clinical significance of oropharyngeal C. trachomatis \\ninfection is unclear, and prevalence is low, even among \\npopulations at high risk. However, when gonorrhea testing \\nis performed at the oropharyngeal site, chlamydia test results \\nmight be reported because certain NAATs detect both bacteria \\nfrom a single specimen.\\n\\nPOC tests for C. trachomatis among asymptomatic persons \\ncan expedite treatment of infected persons and their sex \\npartners. Among symptomatic patients, POC tests for \\nC. trachomatis can optimize treatment by limiting unnecessary \\npresumptive treatment at the time of clinical decision-making \\nand improve antimicrobial stewardship. Thus, using a POC \\ntest will likely be a cost-effective diagnostic strategy for \\nC. trachomatis infection (807). Newer NAAT-based POC tests \\nhave promising performance and are becoming commercially \\navailable (807–809).\\n\\nTreatment\\nTreating persons with C. trachomatis prevents adverse \\n\\nreproductive health complications and continued sexual \\ntransmission. Furthermore, treating their sex partners \\ncan prevent reinfection and infection of other partners. \\nTreating pregnant women usually prevents transmission of \\nC. trachomatis to neonates during birth. Treatment should be \\nprovided promptly for all persons with chlamydial infection; \\ntreatment delays have been associated with complications (e.g., \\nPID) in a limited proportion of women (810).\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection Among \\nAdolescents and Adults\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\n\\nAlternative Regimens\\n\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose\\nor\\n\\nLevofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days\\n\\nA meta-analysis and a Cochrane systematic review evaluated \\ndata from randomized clinical trials of azithromycin versus \\ndoxycycline for treating urogenital chlamydial infection \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 67US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ndetermined that microbiologic treatment failure among men \\nwas higher for azithromycin than for doxycycline (748,749). \\nObservational studies have also demonstrated that doxycycline \\nis more efficacious for rectal C. trachomatis infection for men \\nand women than azithromycin (748,811). A randomized trial \\nfor the treatment of rectal chlamydia infection among MSM \\nreported microbiologic cure was 100% with doxycycline and \\n74% with azithromycin (812). A published review reported \\nthat C. trachomatis was detected at the anorectal site among \\n33%–83% of women who had urogenital C. trachomatis \\ninfection, and its detection was not associated with report of \\nreceptive anorectal sexual activity (813).\\n\\nAlthough the clinical significance of oropharyngeal \\nC. trachomatis infection is unclear and routine oropharyngeal \\nscreening is not recommended, oropharyngeal C. trachomatis \\ncan be sexually transmitted to genital sites (211,814); therefore, \\nif C. trachomatis is identified from an oropharyngeal specimen \\nwhile screening for pharyngeal gonorrhea, it should be treated. \\nEvidence is limited regarding the efficacy of antimicrobial \\nregimens for oropharyngeal chlamydia; however, a recently \\npublished observational study indicates doxycycline might \\nbe more efficacious than azithromycin for oropharyngeal \\nchlamydia (815).\\n\\nAvailable evidence supports that doxycycline is efficacious \\nfor C. trachomatis infections of urogenital, rectal, and \\noropharyngeal sites. Although azithromycin maintains high \\nefficacy for urogenital C. trachomatis infection among women, \\nconcern exists regarding effectiveness of azithromycin for \\nconcomitant rectal C. trachomatis infection, which can occur \\ncommonly among women and cannot be predicted by reported \\nsexual activity. Inadequately treated rectal C. trachomatis \\ninfection among women who have urogenital chlamydia \\ncan increase the risk for transmission and place women at \\nrisk for repeat urogenital C. trachomatis infection through \\nautoinoculation from the anorectal site (816). Doxycycline is \\nalso available in a delayed-release 200-mg tablet formulation, \\nwhich requires once-daily dosing for 7 days and is as effective \\nas doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treating \\nurogenital C. trachomatis infection in men and women. It is \\nmore costly but also has lower frequency of gastrointestinal \\nside effects (817). Levofloxacin is an effective treatment \\nalternative but is more expensive. Erythromycin is no longer \\nrecommended because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side \\neffects, which can result in nonadherence. When nonadherence \\nto doxycycline regimen is a substantial concern, azithromycin \\n1 g regimen is an alternative treatment option but might \\nrequire posttreatment evaluation and testing because it has \\ndemonstrated lower treatment efficacy among persons with \\nrectal infection.\\n\\nAmong persons receiving multidose regimens, medication \\nshould be dispensed with all doses involved, on-site and in \\nthe clinic, and the first dose should be directly observed. To \\nmaximize adherence with recommended therapies, on-site, \\ndirectly observed single-dose therapy with azithromycin should \\nalways be available for persons for whom adherence with \\nmultiday dosing is a considerable concern.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nTo minimize disease transmission to sex partners, persons \\n\\ntreated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from \\nsexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until \\ncompletion of a 7-day regimen and resolution of symptoms if \\npresent. To minimize risk for reinfection, patients also should \\nbe instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their \\nsex partners have been treated. Persons who receive a diagnosis \\nof chlamydia should be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. \\nMSM who are HIV negative with a rectal chlamydia diagnosis \\nshould be offered HIV PrEP.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nTest of cure to detect therapeutic failure (i.e., repeat testing \\n\\n4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for nonpregnant \\npersons treated with the recommended or alternative regimens, \\nunless therapeutic adherence is in question, symptoms persist, \\nor reinfection is suspected. Moreover, using chlamydial NAATs \\nat <4 weeks after completion of therapy is not recommended \\nbecause the continued presence of nonviable organisms \\n(553,818,819) can lead to false-positive results.\\n\\nA high prevalence of C. trachomatis infection has been \\nobserved among women and men who were treated \\nfor chlamydial infection during the preceding months \\n(753,755,820–822). The majority of posttreatment infections \\ndo not result from treatment failure but rather from reinfection \\ncaused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or \\ninitiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner (823), \\nindicating a need for improved education and treatment of \\nsex partners. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID \\nand other complications among women. Men and women \\nwho have been treated for chlamydia should be retested \\napproximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether \\nthey believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the \\nfollow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged (753). \\nIf retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest \\nwhenever persons next seek medical care <12 months after \\ninitial treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSex partners should be referred for evaluation, testing, and \\n\\npresumptive treatment if they had sexual contact with the \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n68 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\npartner during the 60 days preceding the patient’s onset of \\nsymptoms or chlamydia diagnosis. Although the exposure \\nintervals defining identification of sex partners at risk are \\nbased on limited data, the most recent sex partner should be \\nevaluated and treated, even if the time of the last sexual contact \\nwas >60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis.\\n\\nIf health department partner management strategies (e.g., \\ndisease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable \\nfor persons with chlamydia, and if a provider is concerned \\nthat sex partners are unable to promptly access evaluation and \\ntreatment services, EPT should be considered as permitted by \\nlaw (see Partner Services). Compared with standard patient \\nreferral of partners, this approach to therapy, which involves \\ndelivering the medication itself or a prescription by the \\npatient or collaborating pharmacy, has been associated with \\ndecreased rates of persistent or recurrent chlamydia among \\nwomen (125–127). Providers should provide patients with \\nwritten educational materials to give to their partners about \\nchlamydia, which should include notification that partners \\nhave been exposed and information about the importance \\nof treatment. These materials also should inform partners \\nabout potential therapy-related allergies and adverse effects, \\nalong with symptoms indicative of complications (e.g., \\ntesticular pain among men and pelvic or abdominal pain \\namong women). Educational materials for female partners \\nshould include information about the importance of seeking \\nmedical evaluation, especially if PID symptoms are present; \\nundertreatment of PID among female partners and missed \\nopportunities for diagnosing other STIs among women \\nare concerning. MSM with chlamydia have a high risk for \\ncoexisting infections, especially undiagnosed HIV, among \\ntheir partners and might have partners without HIV who \\ncould benefit from HIV PrEP. Data are also limited regarding \\neffectiveness of EPT in reducing persistent or recurrent \\nchlamydia among MSM (123,133,134); thus, shared clinical \\ndecision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended. \\nHaving partners accompany patients when they return for \\ntreatment is another strategy that has been used successfully \\nfor ensuring partner treatment (see Partner Services). To avoid \\nreinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from \\ncondomless sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners \\nhave been treated (i.e., after completion of a 7-day regimen) \\nand any symptoms have resolved.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nClinical experience and published studies indicate that \\n\\nazithromycin is safe and effective during pregnancy (824–826). \\nDoxycycline is contraindicated during the second and third \\n\\ntrimesters of pregnancy because of risk for tooth discoloration. \\nHuman data reveal that levofloxacin presents a low risk to the \\nfetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during \\nbreastfeeding; however, data from animal studies increase \\nconcerns regarding cartilage damage to neonates (431).\\n\\nTest of cure (i.e., repeat testing after completion of therapy) \\nto document chlamydial eradication, preferably by NAAT, \\nat approximately 4 weeks after therapy completion during \\npregnancy is recommended because severe sequelae can occur \\namong mothers and neonates if the infection persists. In \\naddition, all pregnant women who have chlamydial infection \\ndiagnosed should be retested 3 months after treatment. \\nDetection of C. trachomatis infection during the third semester \\nis not uncommon among adolescent and young adult women, \\nincluding those without C. trachomatis detected at the time of \\ninitial prenatal screening (827). Women aged <25 years and \\nthose at increased risk for chlamydia (i.e., those who have a \\nnew sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \\nconcurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) should \\nbe screened at the first prenatal visit and rescreened during the \\nthird trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications \\nand chlamydial infection in the infant (149).\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection During \\nPregnancy\\n\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose \\n\\nAlternative Regimen\\n\\nAmoxicillin 500 mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days\\n\\nBecause of concerns regarding chlamydia persistence \\nafter exposure to penicillin-class antibiotics that has been \\ndemonstrated in animal and in vitro studies, amoxicillin is \\nlisted as an alternative therapy for C. trachomatis for pregnant \\nwomen (828,829). Erythromycin is no longer recommended \\nbecause of the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects that can \\nresult in therapy nonadherence. In addition, systematic reviews \\nand meta-analyses have noted an association with macrolide \\nantimicrobials, especially erythromycin, during pregnancy and \\nadverse child outcomes, indicating cautious use in pregnancy \\n(830–831).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons who have chlamydia and HIV infection should \\n\\nreceive the same treatment regimen as those who do not \\nhave HIV.\\n\\nChlamydial Infection Among Neonates\\nPrenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women is \\n\\nthe best method for preventing chlamydial infection among \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 69US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nneonates. C. trachomatis infection of neonates results from \\nperinatal exposure to the mother’s infected cervix. Initial \\nC. trachomatis neonatal infection involves the mucous \\nmembranes of the eye, oropharynx, urogenital tract, and \\nrectum, although infection might be asymptomatic in these \\nlocations. Instead, C. trachomatis infection among neonates \\nis most frequently recognized by conjunctivitis that develops \\n5–12 days after birth. C. trachomatis also can cause a subacute, \\nafebrile pneumonia with onset at ages 1–3 months. Although \\nC. trachomatis has been the most frequent identifiable \\ninfectious cause of ophthalmia neonatorum, neonatal \\nchlamydial infections, including ophthalmia and pneumonia, \\nhave occurred less frequently since institution of widespread \\nprenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women. Neonates \\nborn to mothers at high risk for chlamydial infection, with \\nuntreated chlamydia, or with no or unconfirmed prenatal care, \\nare at high risk for infection. However, presumptive treatment \\nof the neonate is not indicated because the efficacy of such \\ntreatment is unknown.

As an alternative, prevention efforts should \\nfocus on prenatal screening for C. trachomatis, including\\n\\n• screening pregnant women at risk for C. trachomatis \\ninfection at the first prenatal visit (e.g., women aged \\n<25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new sex \\npartner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \\nconcurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI);\\n\\n• treating all pregnant women with C. trachomatis during \\npregnancy and performing a test of cure 4 weeks after \\ntreatment to verify chlamydial eradication; these women \\nshould also be retested 3 months after treatment and again \\nin the third trimester or at time of delivery, and their \\npartners should also be tested and treated;\\n\\n• retesting pregnant women during the third trimester who \\ninitially tested negative but remained at increased risk for \\nacquiring infection (e.g., women aged <25 years and those \\naged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one \\nsex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a \\nsex partner who has an STI); and\\n\\n• screening at delivery those pregnant women who were not \\nscreened for C. trachomatis during pregnancy if at risk or \\nwho had no prenatal care; physicians and others caring \\nfor the mother and the newborn should communicate to \\nensure follow-up on the results of laboratory tests \\nperformed at delivery, and if positive, prompt and age-\\nappropriate treatment for the newborn and the mother.\\n\\nNeonates born to mothers for whom prenatal chlamydia \\nscreening has been confirmed and the results are negative are \\nnot at high risk for infection.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nSensitive and specific methods for diagnosing chlamydial \\n\\nophthalmia in the neonate include both tissue culture and \\nnonculture tests (e.g., DFA tests and NAATs). DFA is the \\nonly nonculture FDA-cleared test for detecting chlamydia \\nfrom conjunctival swabs. NAATs are not cleared by FDA for \\ndetecting chlamydia from conjunctival swabs, and clinical \\nlaboratories should verify the procedure according to CLIA \\nregulations. Specimens for culture isolation and nonculture \\ntests should be obtained from the everted eyelid by using a \\nDacron (DuPont)-tipped swab or the swab specified by the \\nmanufacturer’s test kit; for culture and DFA, specimens must \\ncontain conjunctival cells, not exudate alone. Ocular specimens \\nfrom neonates being evaluated for chlamydial conjunctivitis \\nalso should be tested for N. gonorrhoeae (see Ophthalmia \\nNeonatorum Caused by N. gonorrhoeae).\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection Among \\nNeonates\\n\\nErythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg body weight/day \\norally, divided into 4 doses daily for 14 days*\\n* An association between oral erythromycin and azithromycin and infantile \\n\\nhypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has been reported among infants \\naged <6 weeks.

Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate for \\ntreating ophthalmia neonatorum caused by chlamydia and is \\nunnecessary when systemic treatment is administered.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n70 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nBecause the efficacy of erythromycin treatment for \\n\\nophthalmia neonatorum is approximately 80%, a second \\ncourse of therapy might be required (834,835). Data regarding \\nthe efficacy of azithromycin for ophthalmia neonatorum are \\nlimited. Therefore, follow-up of infants is recommended to \\ndetermine whether the initial treatment was effective. The \\npossibility of concomitant chlamydial pneumonia should be \\nconsidered (see Infant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis).\\n\\nManagement of Mothers and Their Sex Partners\\nMothers of infants who have ophthalmia caused by chlamydia \\n\\nand the sex partners of these women should be evaluated and \\npresumptively treated for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infection \\nAmong Adolescents and Adults).\\n\\nInfant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis\\nChlamydial pneumonia among infants typically occurs at age \\n\\n1–3 months and is a subacute pneumonia. Characteristic signs \\nof chlamydial pneumonia among infants include a repetitive \\nstaccato cough with tachypnea and hyperinflation and bilateral \\ndiffuse infiltrates on a chest radiograph. In addition, peripheral \\neosinophilia (≥400 cells/mm3) occurs frequently. Because \\nclinical presentations differ, all infants aged 1–3 months \\nsuspected of having pneumonia, especially those whose \\nmothers have a history of, are at risk for (e.g., aged <25 years \\nand those aged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more \\nthan one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, \\nor a sex partner who has an STI), or suspected of having a \\nchlamydial infection should be tested for C. trachomatis and \\ntreated if infected.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nSpecimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from \\n\\nthe nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard \\ndiagnostic test for chlamydial pneumonia. Nonculture \\ntests (e.g., DFA and NAAT) can be used. DFA is the only \\nnonculture FDA-cleared test for detecting C. trachomatis from \\nnasopharyngeal specimens; however, DFA of nasopharyngeal \\nspecimens has a lower sensitivity and specificity than culture. \\nNAATs are not cleared by FDA for detecting chlamydia from \\nnasopharyngeal specimens, and clinical laboratories should \\nverify the procedure according to CLIA regulations (553). \\nTracheal aspirates and lung biopsy specimens, if collected, \\nshould be tested for C. trachomatis.\\n\\nTreatment\\nBecause test results for chlamydia often are unavailable at the \\n\\ntime initial treatment decisions are being made, treatment for \\nC. trachomatis pneumonia frequently is based on clinical and \\n\\nradiologic findings, age of the infant (i.e., 1–3 months), and \\nrisk for chlamydia in the mother (i.e., aged <25 years, history \\nof chlamydial infection, multiple sex partners, a sex partner \\nwith a concurrent partner, or a sex partner with a history of \\nan STI). In the absence of laboratory results in a situation \\nwith a high degree of suspicion of chlamydial infection and \\nthe mother is unlikely to return with the infant for follow-up, \\nexposed infants can be presumptively treated with the shorter-\\ncourse regimen of azithromycin 20 mg/kg body weight/day \\norally, 1 dose daily for 3 days.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Chlamydial Pneumonia Among \\nInfants\\n\\nErythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg body weight/day orally \\ndivided into 4 doses daily for 14 days\\n\\nAlternative Regimen\\n\\nAzithromycin suspension 20 mg/kg/day orally, 1 dose daily for 3 days\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nBecause erythromycin effectiveness in treating pneumonia \\n\\ncaused by C. trachomatis is approximately 80%, a second \\ncourse of therapy might be required (836). Data regarding \\neffectiveness of azithromycin in treating chlamydial pneumonia \\nare limited. Follow-up of infants is recommended to determine \\nwhether the pneumonia has resolved, although certain infants \\nwith chlamydial pneumonia continue to have abnormal \\npulmonary function tests later during childhood.\\n\\nManagement of Mothers and Their Sex Partners\\nMothers of infants who have chlamydial pneumonia and the \\n\\nsex partners of these women should be evaluated, tested, and \\npresumptively treated for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infection \\nAmong Adolescents and Adults).\\n\\nChlamydial Infection Among Infants and \\nChildren\\n\\nSexual abuse should be considered a cause of chlamydial \\ninfection among infants and children. However, perinatally \\ntransmitted C. trachomatis infection of the nasopharynx, \\nurogenital tract, and rectum can persist for 2–3 years (see \\nSexual Assault or Abuse of Children).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nNAATs can be used to test vaginal and urine specimens \\n\\nfrom girls and urine in boys (see Sexual Assault or Abuse \\nof Children). Data are lacking regarding use of NAATs for \\nspecimens from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) among \\nboys and girls (553); other nonculture tests (e.g., DFA) are \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 71US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nnot recommended because of specificity concerns. Although \\ndata regarding NAATs for specimens from extragenital sites for \\nchildren are more limited and performance is test dependent \\n(553), no evidence supports that NAAT performance \\nfor detecting C. trachomatis for extragenital sites among \\nchildren would differ from that among adults. Because of \\nthe implications of a diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection in \\na child, only CLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAAT should be \\nused for extragenital site specimens (837).\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Chlamydial Infection Among \\nInfants and Children\\n\\nFor infants and children weighing <45 kg: Erythromycin base or ethyl \\nsuccinate 50 mg/kg body weight/day orally divided into 4 doses daily \\nfor 14 days\\n\\nData are limited regarding the effectiveness and optimal dose of \\nazithromycin for treating chlamydial infection among infants and \\nchildren weighing <45 kg.\\n\\nFor children weighing ≥45 kg but aged <8 years: Azithromycin 1 g \\norally in a single dose\\n\\nFor children aged ≥8 years: Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose\\nor\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nSee Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nA test of cure to detect therapeutic failure ensures treatment \\n\\neffectiveness and should be obtained at a follow-up visit \\napproximately 4 weeks after treatment is completed.\\n\\nGonococcal Infections\\nGonococcal Infection Among \\n\\nAdolescents and Adults\\nIn the United States, an estimated 1,568,000 new \\n\\nN. gonorrhoeae infections occur each year (141,838), and \\ngonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial \\ncommunicable disease. Urethral infections caused by \\nN. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause \\nthem to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent \\nsequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission \\nto others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly \\nasymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms \\nuntil complications (e.g., PID) have occurred. PID can result in \\ntubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.\\n\\nAnnual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended \\nfor all sexually active women aged <25 years and for older \\n\\nwomen at increased risk for infection (e.g., those aged ≥25 years \\nwho have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex \\npartner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has \\nan STI) (149). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include \\ninconsistent condom use among persons who are not in \\nmutually monogamous relationships, previous or coexisting \\nSTIs, and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Clinicians \\nshould consider the communities they serve and consult local \\npublic health authorities for guidance regarding identifying \\ngroups at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is \\nconcentrated in specific geographic locations and communities. \\nMSM at high risk for gonococcal infection (e.g., those with \\nmultiple anonymous partners or substance abuse) or those at \\nrisk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic \\nsites of exposure every 3–6 months (see Men Who Have Sex \\nwith Men). At least annual screening is recommended for all \\nMSM. Screening for gonorrhea among heterosexual men and \\nwomen aged >25 years who are at low risk for infection is \\nnot recommended (149). A recent travel history with sexual \\ncontacts outside the United States should be part of any \\ngonorrhea evaluation.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nSpecific microbiologic diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection \\n\\nshould be performed for all persons at risk for or suspected of \\nhaving gonorrhea; a specific diagnosis can potentially reduce \\ncomplications, reinfections, and transmission. Culture, NAAT, \\nand POC NAAT, such as GeneXpert (Cepheid), are available \\nfor detecting genitourinary infection with N. gonorrhoeae \\n(149); culture requires endocervical (women) or urethral \\n(men) swab specimens. Culture is also available for detecting \\nrectal, oropharyngeal, and conjunctival gonococcal infection. \\nNAATs and POC NAATs) allow for the widest variety of \\nFDA-cleared specimen types, including endocervical and \\nvaginal swabs and urine for women, urethral swabs and urine \\nfor men, and rectal swabs and pharyngeal swabs for men and \\nwomen (www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K121710.\\npdf ). However, product inserts for each NAAT manufacturer \\nshould be consulted carefully because collection methods \\nand specimen types vary. Certain NAATs that have been \\ndemonstrated to detect commensal Neisseria species might \\nhave comparable low specificity when testing oropharyngeal \\nspecimens for N. gonorrhoeae (553). NAAT sensitivity for \\ndetecting N. gonorrhoeae from urogenital and nongenital \\nanatomic sites is superior to culture but varies by NAAT type \\n(553,800–803). For urogenital infections, optimal specimen \\ntypes for gonorrhea screening using NAATs include first-void \\nurine for men and vaginal swab specimens for women (553). \\nPatient-collected samples can be used in place of provider-\\ncollected samples in clinical settings when testing by NAAT \\n\\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K121710.pdf\\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K121710.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n72 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nfor urine (men and women), vaginal swabs, rectal swabs, and \\noropharyngeal swabs after patient instructions have been \\nprovided (209,806,839–842). Patient-collected specimens \\nare reasonable alternatives to provider-collected swabs for \\ngonorrhea screening by NAAT.\\n\\nIn cases of suspected or documented treatment failure, \\nclinicians should perform both culture and antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility testing because NAATs cannot provide \\nantimicrobial susceptibility results. Because N. gonorrhoeae \\nhas demanding nutritional and environmental growth \\nrequirements, optimal recovery rates are achieved when \\nspecimens are inoculated directly and when the growth \\nmedium is promptly incubated in an increased carbon dioxide \\n(CO2) environment (553). Nonnutritive swab transport \\nsystems are available that might maintain gonococcal viability \\nfor <48 hours in ambient temperatures (843–845).\\n\\nBecause of its high specificity (>99%) and sensitivity \\n(>95%), a Gram stain of urethral discharge or secretions that \\ndemonstrate polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular \\ngram-negative diplococci can be considered diagnostic for \\ninfection with N. gonorrhoeae among symptomatic men. \\nHowever, because of lower sensitivity, a negative Gram stain \\nshould not be considered sufficient for ruling out infection \\namong asymptomatic men. Infection detection by using \\nGram stain of endocervical, pharyngeal, and rectal specimens \\nalso is insensitive and is not recommended. MB or GV stain \\nof urethral secretions is an alternative POC diagnostic test \\nwith performance characteristics similar to Gram stain. \\nGonococcal infection is diagnosed among symptomatic men by \\ndocumenting the presence of a WBC-containing intracellular \\npurple diplococci in MB or GV smears.\\n\\nAntimicrobial-Resistant N. gonorrhoeae\\nGonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of \\n\\nN. gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobials \\n(846–848). In 1986, the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance \\nProject (GISP), a national sentinel surveillance system, was \\nestablished to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities \\nof urethral N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States \\n(849). The epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance guides \\ndecisions about gonococcal treatment recommendations \\nand has evolved because of shifts in antimicrobial resistance \\npatterns. During 2007, emergence of fluoroquinolone-\\nresistant N. gonorrhoeae in the United States prompted CDC \\nto cease recommending fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea \\ntreatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining \\nclass of antimicrobials available for gonorrhea treatment in \\nthe United States (850). Reflecting concern about emerging \\ngonococcal resistance, CDC’s 2010 STD treatment guidelines \\nrecommended dual therapy for gonorrhea with a cephalosporin \\n\\nplus either azithromycin or doxycycline, even if NAAT for \\nC. trachomatis was negative at the time of treatment (851). \\nHowever, during 2006–2011, the minimum concentrations of \\ncefixime needed to inhibit in vitro growth of the N. gonorrhoeae \\nstrains circulating in the United States and other countries \\nincreased, demonstrating that cefixime effectiveness might be \\nwaning (851). In addition, treatment failures with cefixime or \\nother oral cephalosporins were reported in Asia (852–855), \\nEurope (856–860), South Africa (861), and Canada (862,863). \\nDuring that time, case reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures \\nfor pharyngeal infections reported in Australia (864,865), \\nJapan (866), and Europe were concerning (856,867). \\nConsequently, CDC no longer recommends cefixime as a \\nfirst-line regimen for gonorrhea treatment in the United \\nStates (868). Since 2013, the proportion of GISP isolates \\nthat demonstrate reduced susceptibility (minimal inhibitory \\nconcentration [MIC] ≥2.0 µg/mL) to azithromycin has \\nincreased almost tenfold, to 5.1% in 2019 (141). Unlike the \\nappearance of ciprofloxacin resistance in the early 2000s, and \\ncefixime reduced-susceptibility isolates during 2010–2011, \\nemergence of azithromycin resistance is not concentrated \\namong certain populations (e.g., MSM in the western United \\nStates). Azithromycin has unique pharmacokinetic properties \\nthat might predispose to resistance due to its prolonged half-life \\n(869,870). With the exception of a small cluster of gonorrhea \\nstrains with azithromycin resistance and reduced susceptibility \\nto cefixime and ceftriaxone among seven patients during 2016, \\nall gonorrhea strains identified by GISP are susceptible to \\neither or both azithromycin and ceftriaxone or cefixime. In \\naddition, since 2013, antimicrobial stewardship has become \\nan urgent public health concern in the United States as \\ndescribed in Antimicrobial Resistant Threats in the United States \\n(871). Emergence of azithromycin resistance is not isolated to \\nN. gonorrhoeae; it has also been demonstrated in M. genitalium \\nand such enteric pathogens as Shigella and Campylobacter (see \\nMycoplasma genitalium; Proctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis). \\nFinally, concern exists regarding azithromycin treatment \\nefficacy for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections).\\n\\nDual therapy for gonococcal infection with ceftriaxone \\nand azithromycin recommended in previous guidance \\nmight have mitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to \\nceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae; however, concerns regarding \\npotential harm to the microbiome and the effect on other \\npathogens diminishes the benefits of maintaining dual therapy. \\nConsequently, only ceftriaxone is recommended for treating \\ngonorrhea in the United States (872). Clinicians remaining \\nvigilant for treatment failures is paramount, and CDC plans \\nto continue to monitor for changing ceftriaxone MICs \\nuntil additional antimicrobials or a vaccine is available. In \\ncases in which chlamydial infection has not been excluded, \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 73US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\npatients should also receive antichlamydial therapy. CDC \\nand state health departments participate in CDC-supported \\ngonorrhea surveillance activities (https://www.cdc.gov/std/\\ngisp) and can provide the most current information regarding \\ngonococcal susceptibility.\\n\\nCriteria for resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone have not \\nbeen defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute \\n(CLSI). However, isolates with cefixime or ceftriaxone MICs \\n≥0.5 µg/mL are considered to have decreased susceptibility \\n(873). In the United States, the proportion of isolates in \\nGISP demonstrating decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone \\nor cefixime has remained low; during 2019, <0.1% of isolates \\nwith decreased susceptibility (MIC ≥0.5 µg/mL) to ceftriaxone \\nor cefixime were identified (141). Because increasing MICs \\nmight predict resistance emergence, GISP established lower \\ncephalosporin MIC threshold values that are lower than the \\nsusceptibility breakpoints set by CLSI to provide greater \\nsensitivity in detecting decreasing gonococcal susceptibility \\nfor surveillance purposes. The percentage of isolates with \\ncefixime MICs ≥0.25 µg/mL increased from 0.1% during \\n2006 to 1.4% during 2011 (851,874) and declined to \\n0.3% during 2019 (141). The percentage of isolates with \\nceftriaxone MICs ≥0.125 µg/mL increased from <0.1% in \\n2006 to 0.4% in 2011 and decreased to 0.1% in 2019 (141). \\nIsolates with high-level cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs (MICs \\n= 1.5–8.0 µg/mL and MICs = 1.5–4.0 µg/mL, respectively) \\nhave been identified in Japan (866), France (867,875), Spain \\n(876,877), the United Kingdom, and Australia (878,879). \\nDecreased susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to cephalosporins \\nand other antimicrobials is expected to continue; state and \\nlocal surveillance for antimicrobial resistance is crucial for \\nguiding local therapy recommendations (846,847). Although \\napproximately 3% of all U.S. men who have gonococcal \\ninfections are sampled through GISP, surveillance by clinicians \\nalso is crucial. Clinicians who diagnose N. gonorrhoeae infection \\nin a person with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure \\nshould perform culture and AST of relevant clinical specimens, \\nconsult an infectious disease specialist or an STD clinical \\nexpert (https://www.stdccn.org/render/Public) for guidance \\nin clinical management, and report the case to CDC through \\nstate and local public health authorities within 24 hours. \\nIsolates should be saved and sent to CDC through local and \\nstate public health laboratory mechanisms. Health departments \\nshould prioritize notification and culture evaluation for sexual \\npartners of persons with N. gonorrhoeae infection thought \\nto be associated with cephalosporin treatment failure or \\npersons whose isolates demonstrate decreased susceptibility \\nto cephalosporin. Agar dilution is the reference standard \\nand preferred method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing \\nwith N. gonorrhoeae. Antibiotic gradient strips, such as Etest \\n\\n(bioMérieux), can be used and are considered an acceptable \\nalternative for quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing with \\nN. gonorrhoeae when manufacturer instructions are followed. Disc \\ndiffusion only provides qualitative susceptibility results.\\n\\nUncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the \\nCervix, Urethra, or Rectum\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal \\nInfection of the Cervix, Urethra, or Rectum Among Adults and \\nAdolescents\\n\\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose for persons weighing <150 kg\\n\\nIf chlamydial infection has not been excluded, treat for chlamydia with \\ndoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.\\n\\n* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g ceftriaxone should be administered.\\n\\nAlthough clinical data confirm that a single injection \\nof ceftriaxone 250 mg is >99% (95% confidence interval \\n[CI]:\\xa097.6%–99.7%) effective in curing anogenital gonorrhea \\nof circulating isolates (MIC = 0.03 µg/mL), a higher dose is \\nlikely necessary for isolates with elevated MICs (880,881). \\nEffective treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea with \\nceftriaxone requires concentrations higher than the strain MIC \\nfor approximately 24 hours; although individual variability \\nexists in the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone, a 500-mg dose \\nof ceftriaxone is expected to achieve in approximately 50 hours \\nMIC >0.03 µg/mL (880,881).

This trial was not powered \\nenough to provide reliable estimates of the efficacy of these \\nregimens for treatment of rectal or pharyngeal infection; \\nhowever, this regimen cured the few extragenital infections \\namong study participants. Notably, gastrointestinal adverse \\nevents, primarily vomiting <1 hour after dosing, occurred \\namong 3%–4% of persons treated with gentamicin plus \\nazithromycin, necessitating retreatment with ceftriaxone \\nand azithromycin. A similar trial that studied gentamicin \\n240 mg plus azithromycin 1 g determined lower cure rates at \\nextragenital sites; 80% (95% CI:\\xa072%–88%) of pharyngeal \\nand 90% (95% CI:\\xa084%–95%) of rectal infections were cured \\nwith this regimen (886). Gemifloxacin plus azithromycin has \\nbeen studied and is no longer recommended as an alternative \\nregimen because of limited availability, cost, and antimicrobial \\nstewardship concerns (885).\\n\\nAn 800-mg oral dose of cefixime should be considered only \\nas an alternative cephalosporin regimen because it does not \\nprovide as high, nor as sustained, bactericidal blood levels as a \\n500-mg IM dose of ceftriaxone. Furthermore, it demonstrates \\nlimited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea (92.3% \\ncure; 95% CI:\\xa0 74.9%–99.1%); in older clinical studies, \\ncefixime cured 97.5% of uncomplicated urogenital and \\nanorectal gonococcal infections (95% CI:\\xa0 95.4%–99.8%) \\n(883,884). The increase in the prevalence of isolates obtained \\nthrough GISP with elevated cefixime MICs might indicate \\nearly stages of development of clinically significant gonococcal \\nresistance to cephalosporins. Changes in cefixime MICs can \\nresult in decreasing effectiveness of cefixime for treating \\nurogenital gonorrhea. Furthermore, as cefixime becomes \\nless effective, continued used of cefixime might hasten the \\ndevelopment of resistance to ceftriaxone, a safe, well-tolerated, \\ninjectable cephalosporin and the last antimicrobial known to \\nbe highly effective in a single dose for treatment of gonorrhea \\nat all anatomic infection sites. Other oral cephalosporins (e.g., \\ncefpodoxime and cefuroxime) are not recommended because of \\ninferior efficacy and less favorable pharmacodynamics (883).\\n\\nMonotherapy with azithromycin 2 g orally as a single \\ndose has been demonstrated to be 99.2% effective against \\nuncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea (95% CI:\\xa097.3%–99.9%) \\n(883). However, monotherapy is not recommended because \\nof concerns about the ease with which N. gonorrhoeae can \\ndevelop resistance to macrolides, the high proportion of isolates \\nwith azithromycin decreased susceptibility, and documented \\nazithromycin treatment failures (859). Strains of N. gonorrhoeae \\ncirculating in the United States are not adequately susceptible \\n\\nto penicillin, tetracycline, and older macrolides (e.g., \\nerythromycin), and thus use of these antimicrobials cannot \\nbe recommended.\\n\\nSpectinomycin is effective (98.2% in curing uncomplicated \\nurogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections) but has poor \\nefficacy for pharyngeal infections (883,887). It is unavailable \\nin the United States, and the gentamicin alternative regimen \\nhas replaced the need for spectinomycin, if a cephalosporin \\nallergy exists, in the United States.\\n\\nUncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of \\nthe Pharynx\\n\\nThe majority of gonococcal infections of the pharynx are \\nasymptomatic and can be relatively common among certain \\npopulations (800,801,888–890). Although these infections \\nrarely cause complications, they have been reported to be a \\nmajor source of community transmission and might be a driver \\nof antimicrobial resistance (891,892). Gonococcal infections \\nof the pharynx are more difficult to eradicate than infections \\nat urogenital and anorectal sites (862). Few antimicrobial \\nregimens reliably cure >90% of gonococcal pharyngeal \\ninfections (883,884).

If medications are unavailable when \\ntreatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility \\nshould be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize \\ndisease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should \\nbe instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after \\ntreatment and until all sex partners are treated (7 days after \\nreceiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present). \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 75US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nAll persons who receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be \\ntested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. \\nThose persons whose HIV test results are negative should be \\noffered HIV PrEP.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nA test of cure (i.e., repeat testing after completion of \\n\\ntherapy) is unnecessary for persons who receive a diagnosis of \\nuncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated \\nwith any of the recommended or alternative regimens. Any \\nperson with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return 7–14 days \\nafter initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or \\nNAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased \\nlikelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort \\nshould be made to perform a confirmatory culture before \\nretreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All \\npositive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment \\nshould be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or \\nwithout simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. \\nPersistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused \\nby other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).\\n\\nA high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection has been \\nobserved among men and women previously treated for \\ngonorrhea (137,753,754,893). The majority of these infections \\nresult from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to \\nreceive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a \\nnew infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient \\neducation and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who \\nhave been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months \\nafter treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex \\npartners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the \\ntime of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not \\npossible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek \\nmedical care <12 months after initial treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nRecent sex partners (i.e., persons having sexual contact with \\n\\nthe infected patient <60 days preceding onset of symptoms or \\ngonorrhea diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, \\nand presumptive treatment. If the patient’s last potential sexual \\nexposure was >60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, \\nthe most recent sex partner should be treated.\\n\\nIf health department partner-management strategies (e.g., \\ndisease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable \\nfor persons with gonorrhea and partners’ access to prompt \\nclinical evaluation and treatment is limited, EPT can be \\ndelivered to the partner by the patient or a collaborating \\npharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). Treatment \\nof the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose \\n\\nis recommended, provided that concurrent chlamydial \\ninfection has been excluded. If a chlamydia test result has not \\nbeen documented, the partner may be treated with a single \\ndose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg \\n2 times/day for 7 days. If adherence with multiday dosing is \\na considerable concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered \\nbut has lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal \\nchlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections). Provision of medication \\nby EPT should be accompanied by written materials (125,127) \\nfor educating partners about gonorrhea, their exposure to \\ngonorrhea, and the importance of therapy. These materials \\nshould also educate partners about seeking clinical evaluation \\nfor adverse reactions or complications and general follow-up \\nwhen able. Educational materials for female partners should \\ninclude information about the importance of seeking medical \\nevaluation for PID, especially if symptomatic; undertreatment \\nof PID among female partners and missed opportunities for \\ndiagnosing other STIs among women are of concern. MSM \\nwith gonorrhea have a high risk for coexisting infections \\n(especially undiagnosed HIV) among their partners, and they \\nmight have partners without HIV who could benefit from \\nPrEP. Data are also limited regarding the effectiveness of EPT \\nin reducing persistent or recurrent gonorrhea among MSM \\n(133,135); thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding \\nEPT for MSM is recommended (see Partner Services). To avoid \\nreinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from \\ncondomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their \\nsex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of \\nsymptoms, if present.\\n\\nSuspected Cephalosporin Treatment Failure\\nCephalosporin treatment failure is the persistence of \\n\\nN. gonorrhoeae infection despite recommended cephalosporin \\ntreatment; such failure is indicative of infection with \\ncephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea among persons whose \\npartners were treated and whose risk for reinfection is \\nlow. Suspected treatment failure has been reported among \\npersons receiving oral and injectable cephalosporins (852–\\n855,857,859,861,863,864,867,875,894). Treatment failure \\nshould be considered for persons whose symptoms do not \\nresolve within 3–5 days after recommended treatment and \\nreport no sexual contact during the posttreatment follow-up \\nperiod and persons with a positive test of cure (i.e., positive \\nculture >72 hours or positive NAAT >7 days after receiving \\nrecommended treatment) when no sexual contact is reported \\nduring the posttreatment follow-up period (874). Treatment \\nfailure should also be considered for persons who have a \\npositive culture on test of cure, if obtained, if evidence exists \\nof decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins on antimicrobial \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n76 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nsusceptibility testing, regardless of whether sexual contact is \\nreported during the posttreatment follow-up period.\\n\\nThe majority of suspected treatment failures in the United \\nStates are likely to be reinfections rather than actual treatment \\nfailures (137,753,754,894). However, in cases in which \\nreinfection is unlikely and treatment failure is suspected, \\nbefore retreatment, relevant clinical specimens should be \\nobtained for culture (preferably with simultaneous NAAT) \\nand antimicrobial susceptibility testing if N. gonorrhoeae is \\nisolated. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing should \\nbe performed by using Etest or agar dilution. All isolates \\nof suspected treatment failures should be sent to CDC for \\nantimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution; local \\nlaboratories should store isolates for possible further testing if \\nneeded. Testing or storage of specimens or isolates should be \\nfacilitated by the state or local health department according to \\nlocal public health protocol. Instructions for shipping isolates \\nto CDC are available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/\\narg/specimen_shipping_instructions1-29-08.pdf.\\n\\nFor persons with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, \\nthe treating clinician should consult an infectious disease \\nspecialist, the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention \\nTraining Center clinical consultation line (https://www.stdccn.\\norg/render/Public), the local or state health department STI \\nprogram, or CDC (telephone: 800-232-4636) for advice about \\nobtaining cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and \\ntreatment. Suspected treatment failure should be reported to \\nCDC through the local or state health department <24 hours \\nafter diagnosis.\\n\\nPatients with suspected treatment failures should first be \\nretreated routinely with the initial regimen used (ceftriaxone \\n500 mg IM), with the addition of doxycycline if chlamydia \\ninfection exists, because reinfections are more likely than \\nactual treatment failures. However, in situations with a higher \\nlikelihood of treatment failure than reinfection, relevant \\nclinical specimens should be obtained for culture (preferably \\nwith simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility \\ntesting before retreatment. Dual treatment with single doses \\nof IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g can be \\nconsidered, particularly when isolates are identified as having \\nelevated cephalosporin MICs (885,886,895). Persons with \\nsuspected treatment failure after treatment with the alternative \\nregimen (cefixime or gentamicin) should be treated with \\nceftriaxone 500 mg as a single IM dose or as a single dose with \\nor without an antichlamydial agent on the basis of chlamydia \\ninfection status. A test of cure at relevant clinical sites should \\nbe obtained 7–14 days after retreatment; culture is the \\nrecommended test, preferably with simultaneous NAAT, and \\nantimicrobial susceptibility testing of N. gonorrhoeae if isolated. \\nClinicians should ensure that the patients’ sex partners from \\n\\nthe preceding 60 days are evaluated promptly with culture \\nand presumptively treated by using the same regimen used \\nfor the patients.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\nThe risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is highest with \\n\\nfirst-generation cephalosporins but is rare (<1%) with \\nthird-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and \\ncefixime) (631,680,896). Clinicians should first thoroughly \\nassess a patient’s allergy history, including type of reaction, \\nassociated medications, and previous prescription records. \\nIf IgE-mediated penicillin allergy is strongly suspected, dual \\ntreatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral \\nazithromycin 2 g can be administered (885,886). If a patient \\nis asymptomatic and the treating facility is able to perform \\ngyrase A (gyrA) testing to identify ciprofloxacin susceptibility \\n(wild type), oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg in a single dose can be \\nadministered. Providers treating persons with IgE-mediated \\ncephalosporin or penicillin allergy should refer to the section \\nof these guidelines regarding evaluation (see Management of \\nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).\\n\\nPregnancy\\nPregnant women infected with N. gonorrhoeae should be \\n\\ntreated with ceftriaxone 500 mg in a single IM dose plus \\ntreatment for chlamydia if infection has not been excluded. \\nWhen cephalosporin allergy or other considerations preclude \\ntreatment with this regimen, consultation with an infectious \\ndisease specialist or an STD clinical expert is recommended. \\nGentamicin use is cautioned during pregnancy because of risk \\nfor neonatal birth defects, nephrotoxicity, or ototoxicity (897) \\n(https://www.stdccn.org/render/Public).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons who have gonorrhea and HIV infection should \\n\\nreceive the same treatment regimen as those who do not \\nhave HIV.\\n\\nGonococcal Conjunctivitis\\nIn the only published study of the treatment regarding \\n\\ngonococcal conjunctivitis among adults, all 12 study \\nparticipants responded to a single 1-g IM injection of \\nceftriaxone (898).

Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) frequently \\nresults in petechial or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetric \\npolyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, or oligoarticular septic arthritis \\n(899–901). Rarely, DGI is complicated by perihepatitis \\nassociated with gonococcal PID, endocarditis, or meningitis. \\nCertain strains of N. gonorrhoeae that cause DGI can cause \\nminimal genital inflammation, and urogenital or anorectal \\ninfections are often asymptomatic among DGI patients. \\nIf DGI is suspected, NAATs or culture specimens from all \\nexposed urogenital and extragenital sites should be collected \\nand processed, in addition to disseminated sites of infection \\n(e.g., skin, synovial fluid, blood, or CSF). All N. gonorrhoeae \\nisolates should be tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. \\nRisk factors for dissemination have included female sex, \\nmenstruation, pregnancy, and terminal complement deficiency \\n(899); however, reports are increasing among men (900,901). \\nPersons receiving eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that \\ninhibits terminal complement activation, also might be at \\nhigher risk for DGI (902).\\n\\nHospitalization and consultation with an infectious disease \\nspecialist are recommended for initial therapy, especially \\nfor persons who might not comply with treatment, have an \\nuncertain diagnosis, or have purulent synovial effusions or \\nother complications.

The \\nduration of treatment for DGI in these situations has not been \\nsystematically studied and should be determined in consultation \\nwith an infectious disease specialist. Treatment for DGI should \\nbe guided by the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. \\nLength of treatment should be determined based on clinical \\npresentation. Therapy for meningitis should be continued with \\nrecommended parenteral therapy for 10–14 days. Parenteral \\nantimicrobial therapy for endocarditis should be administered \\nfor >4 weeks. Treatment of gonococcal perihepatitis should be \\nmanaged in accordance with the recommendations for PID \\nin these guidelines.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nGonococcal infection frequently is asymptomatic among sex \\n\\npartners of persons who have DGI. Providers should instruct \\npatients to refer partners with whom they have had sexual \\ncontact during the previous 60 days for evaluation, testing, \\nand presumptive treatment (see Gonococcal Infections, \\nManagement of Sex Partners).\\n\\nGonococcal Infection Among Neonates\\nPrenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women for \\n\\ngonorrhea is the best method for preventing N. gonorrhoeae \\ninfection among neonates. Gonococcal infection among \\nneonates results from perinatal exposure to the mother’s infected \\ncervix. It is usually an acute illness that manifests 2–5 days after \\nbirth. Prevalence of infection among neonates depends on the \\nprevalence of infection among pregnant women and whether \\npregnant women are screened and treated for gonorrhea during \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n78 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\npregnancy. The most severe manifestations of N. gonorrhoeae \\ninfection among neonates are ophthalmia neonatorum and \\nsepsis, which can include arthritis and meningitis. Less severe \\nmanifestations include rhinitis, vaginitis, urethritis, and scalp \\ninfection at sites of previous fetal monitoring.\\n\\nPreventing Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by \\nN. gonorrhoeae\\n\\nOcular prophylaxis and preventive gonorrhea screening \\nand treatment of infected pregnant women are especially \\nimportant because ophthalmia neonatorum can result in \\nperforation of the globe of the eye and blindness (903). \\nOcular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum \\nhas a long history of preventing sight-threatening gonococcal \\nocular infections. Cases in the United States are uncommon, \\nwhich is likely attributable to gonorrhea screening programs \\nfor women, including pregnant women, that have contributed \\nsubstantially to reduction in ophthalmia neonatorum (904). \\nNeonatal ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin, the only agent \\navailable in the United States, is required by law in most states \\nand is recommended because of safety, low cost, and ease of \\nadministration. It can contribute to preventing gonococcal \\nblindness because not all pregnant women are screened for \\ngonorrhea. The USPSTF recommends ocular prophylaxis \\nwith erythromycin ointment for all newborns <24 hours \\nafter birth (903). In addition to continuing routine ocular \\nprophylaxis, prevention should focus on prenatal screening \\nfor N. gonorrhoeae, including\\n\\n• screening pregnant women at risk (e.g., women aged \\n<25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new sex \\npartner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \\nconcurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live \\nin a community with high rates of gonorrhea) for \\nN. gonorrhoeae infection at the first prenatal visit;\\n\\n• treating all pregnant women with N. gonorrhoeae infection \\nduring pregnancy and retesting in 3 months, in the third \\ntrimester or at time of delivery (sex partners should be \\ntested and treated);\\n\\n• retesting pregnant women in the third trimester who \\ninitially tested negative but remained at increased risk for \\nacquiring infection (e.g., women aged <25 years and those \\naged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one \\nsex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, a sex \\npartner who has an STI, or live in a community with high \\nrates of gonorrhea); and\\n\\n• screening for gonorrhea at delivery for women not tested \\nduring pregnancy and at risk for infection (e.g., women \\naged <25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new \\nsex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \\nconcurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live \\n\\nin a community with high rates of gonorrhea) or received \\nno prenatal care; providers caring for the mother and the \\nnewborn should communicate to ensure follow-up on the \\nresults of laboratory tests performed at delivery, and if \\npositive, prompt appropriate treatment of the newborn \\nand mother.\\n\\nErythromycin is the only ophthalmic ointment recommended \\nfor use among neonates. Silver nitrate and tetracycline \\nophthalmic ointments are no longer manufactured in the \\nUnited States, bacitracin is ineffective, and povidone iodine \\nhas not been studied adequately (905,906). Gentamicin \\nophthalmic ointment has been associated with severe ocular \\nreactions (907,908). If erythromycin ointment is unavailable, \\ninfants at risk for exposure to N. gonorrhoeae, especially those \\nborn to a mother at risk for gonococcal infection or with no \\nprenatal care, can be administered ceftriaxone 25–50 mg/kg \\nbody weight IV or IM, not to exceed 250 mg in a single dose.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen to Prevent Ophthalmia Neonatorum \\nCaused by N. gonorrhoeae\\n\\nErythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment in each eye in a single \\napplication at birth\\n\\nErythromycin ophthalmic ointment should be instilled \\ninto both eyes of neonates as soon as possible after delivery, \\nregardless of whether they are delivered vaginally or by \\ncesarean delivery. Ideally, ointment should be applied by using \\nsingle-use tubes or ampules rather than multiple-use tubes. If \\nprophylaxis is delayed (i.e., not administered in the delivery \\nroom), a monitoring system should be established to ensure \\nthat all newborns receive prophylaxis <24 hours after delivery.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nNewborns at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia \\n\\ninclude those who did not receive ophthalmic prophylaxis \\nand whose mothers had no prenatal care, have a history \\nof STIs during pregnancy, or have a history of substance \\nmisuse. Gonococcal ophthalmia is strongly suspected when \\nintracellular gram-negative diplococci are identified on Gram \\nstain of conjunctival exudate, justifying presumptive treatment \\nfor gonorrhea after appropriate cultures and antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility testing for N. gonorrhoeae are performed. \\nPresumptive treatment for N. gonorrhoeae might be indicated \\nfor newborns at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia who \\nhave increased WBCs (no GNID) in a Gram-stained smear \\nof conjunctival exudate. Nongonococcal causes of neonatal \\nophthalmia include Moraxella catarrhalis and other Neisseria \\nspecies, which are organisms that are indistinguishable from \\nN. gonorrhoeae on Gram-stained smear but can be differentiated \\nin the microbiology laboratory.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 79US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nTreatment of Gonococcal Ophthalmia Neonatorum\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Gonococcal Ophthalmia \\nNeonatorum\\n\\nCeftriaxone 25–50 mg/kg body weight IV or IM in a single dose, not to \\nexceed 250 mg\\n\\nOne dose of ceftriaxone is adequate therapy for gonococcal \\nophthalmia.

For preadolescent girls, vaginitis is the \\nmost common manifestation of this infection; gonococcal-\\nassociated PID after vaginal infection can be less common \\namong preadolescents than adults. Among sexually abused \\nchildren, anorectal and pharyngeal infections with N. \\ngonorrhoeae are frequently asymptomatic.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nCulture can be used to test urogenital and extragenital sites for \\n\\ngirls and boys. NAAT can be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae from \\nvaginal and urine specimens from girls and urine for boys (see \\nSexual Assault or Abuse of Children). Although data regarding \\nNAAT from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) among \\nchildren are more limited, and performance is test dependent, \\nno evidence supports that performance of NAAT for detection \\nof N. gonorrhoeae among children differs from that among adults \\n(553). Because of the implications of a N. gonorrhoeae diagnosis \\nin a child, only validated FDA-cleared NAAT assays should be \\nused with extragenital specimens. Consultation with an expert \\nis necessary before using NAAT to minimize the possibility of \\ncross-reaction with nongonococcal Neisseria species and other \\ncommensals (e.g., N. meningitidis, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria \\nlactamica, Neisseria cinerea, or M. catarrhalis) and to ensure \\ncorrect interpretation of results.\\n\\nGram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children \\nfor gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude \\ngonorrhea.

All children identified as having gonococcal \\ninfections should be tested for C. trachomatis, syphilis, and \\nHIV (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).\\n\\nMycoplasma genitalium\\nM. genitalium causes symptomatic and asymptomatic \\n\\nurethritis among men and is the etiology of approximately \\n15%–20% of NGU, 20%–25% of nonchlamydial NGU, \\nand 40% of persistent or recurrent urethritis (697,909,910). \\nInfection with C. trachomatis is common in selected geographic \\nareas (911–913), although M. genitalium is often the sole \\npathogen. Data are insufficient to implicate M. genitalium \\ninfection with chronic complications among men (e.g., \\nepididymitis, prostatitis, or infertility). The consequences \\nof asymptomatic infection with M. genitalium among men \\nare unknown.\\n\\nAmong women, M. genitalium has been associated with \\ncervicitis, PID, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, and \\ninfertility, with an approximately twofold increase in the risk \\nfor these outcomes among women infected with M. genitalium \\n(766). M. genitalium infections among women are also \\nfrequently asymptomatic, and the consequences associated \\nwith asymptomatic M. genitalium infection are unknown.\\n\\nM. genitalium can be detected among 10%–30% of women \\nwith clinical cervicitis (767,770,772,914–916). The existing \\nevidence between M. genitalium and cervicitis is mostly \\nsupportive of a causal association. Elevated proinflammatory \\ncytokines have been demonstrated among women with \\nM. genitalium, with return to baseline levels after clearance of \\nthe pathogen (917).\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 81US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nM. genitalium is identified in the cervix or endometrium \\nof women with PID more often than in women without PID \\n(918–924). Prevalence of M. genitalium among women with \\nPID ranges from 4% to 22% (925,926) and was reported \\nas 60% in one study of women with postabortal PID (918). \\nThe association with PID is supported by early studies among \\nnonhuman primates that determined that endosalpingitis \\ndevelops after inoculation with M. genitalium (927). Recent \\nstudies evaluating the lower and upper genital tract using \\nhighly sensitive M. genitalium NAAT assays or the role of \\nM. genitalium in histologically defined endometritis have \\nreported significantly elevated risk for PID (928). However, \\nmost studies of M. genitalium and PID, even those that \\ncontrolled extensively for other infections and behavioral and \\nbiologic risk, are cross-sectional. The few prospective studies \\nthat have evaluated the role of M. genitalium in establishing \\nsubsequent PID demonstrated increased PID risk; however, \\nthese were not statistically significant associations, often \\nbecause of a lack of statistical power. No clinical trial data are \\navailable that demonstrate that treating M. genitalium cervical \\ninfection prevents development of PID or endometritis. \\nAlthough data regarding the benefits of testing women with \\nPID for M. genitalium and the importance of directing \\ntreatment against this organism are limited, the associations of \\nM. genitalium with cervicitis and PID in cross-sectional studies \\nusing NAAT testing are consistent (928).\\n\\nData from case-control serologic studies (929–931) \\nand a meta-analysis of clinical studies (766) indicate a \\npotential role in causing infertility. However, seroassays are \\nsuboptimal and inconclusive. Similarly, evidence for a role for \\nM. genitalium infection during pregnancy as a cause of perinatal \\ncomplications, including preterm delivery, spontaneous \\nabortion, or low birthweight, are conflicting because evidence is \\ninsufficient to attribute cause (766,932–934). Data are limited \\nregarding ectopic pregnancy and neonatal M. genitalium \\ninfection (935,936).\\n\\nRectal infection with M. genitalium has been reported among \\n1%–26% of MSM (937–940) and among 3% of women \\n(941). Rectal infections often are asymptomatic, although \\nhigher prevalence of M. genitalium has been reported among \\nmen with rectal symptoms. Similarly, although asymptomatic \\nM. genitalium has been detected in the pharynx, no evidence \\nexists of it causing oropharyngeal symptoms or systemic disease.\\n\\nUrogenital M. genitalium infection is associated with HIV \\namong both men and women (942–944); however, the data \\nare from case-control and cross-sectional studies. Risk for HIV \\ninfection is increased among women with M. genitalium, and \\nevidence indicates that HIV shedding occurs more often among \\npersons with M. genitalium and HIV infection who are not taking \\nART than among persons without M. genitalium (942,944).\\n\\nAntimicrobial Resistance\\nResistance to azithromycin has been rapidly increasing \\n\\nand has been confirmed in multiple studies. Prevalence of \\nmolecular markers for macrolide resistance, which highly \\ncorrelates with treatment failure, ranges from 44% to 90% \\nin the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia \\n(697,702,945–953). Treatment with azithromycin alone \\nhas been reported to select for resistance (705,954,955), \\nwith treatment of macrolide-susceptible infections with a \\n1-g dose of azithromycin resulting in selection of resistant-\\nstrain populations in 10%–12% of cases. The prevalence of \\nquinolone resistance markers is much lower (697,956–959). \\nThe first clinical treatment failures after moxifloxacin were \\nassociated specifically with the S83I mutation in the parC gene \\n(954,960). Prevalence of the S83I mutation in the United \\nStates ranges from 0% to 15% (947); however, correlation \\nwith fluoroquinolone treatment failure is less consistent than \\nthat with mutations associated with macrolide resistance \\n(953,961,962). Clinically relevant quinolone resistance often \\nis associated with coexistent macrolide resistance (954).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nM. genitalium is an extremely slow-growing organism. Culture \\n\\ncan take up to 6 months, and technical laboratory capacity is \\nlimited to research settings. NAAT for M. genitalium is FDA \\ncleared for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, \\nand vaginal swab samples (https://www.hologic.com/package-\\ninserts/diagnostic-products/aptima-mycoplasma-genitalium-\\nassay). Molecular tests for macrolide (i.e., azithromycin) or \\nquinolone (i.e., moxifloxacin) resistance markers are not \\ncommercially available in the United States. However, molecular \\nassays that incorporate detection of mutations associated with \\nmacrolide resistance are under evaluation.\\n\\nMen with recurrent NGU should be tested for M. genitalium \\nusing an FDA-cleared NAAT. If resistance testing is available, \\nit should be performed and the results used to guide therapy. \\nWomen with recurrent cervicitis should be tested for \\nM. genitalium, and testing should be considered among women \\nwith PID. Testing should be accompanied with resistance \\ntesting, if available. Screening of asymptomatic M. genitalium \\ninfection among women and men or extragenital testing \\nfor M. genitalium is not recommended. In clinical practice, \\nif testing is unavailable, M. genitalium should be suspected \\nin cases of persistent or recurrent urethritis or cervicitis and \\nconsidered for PID.\\n\\nhttps://www.hologic.com/package-inserts/diagnostic-products/aptima-mycoplasma-genitalium-assay\\nhttps://www.hologic.com/package-inserts/diagnostic-products/aptima-mycoplasma-genitalium-assay\\nhttps://www.hologic.com/package-inserts/diagnostic-products/aptima-mycoplasma-genitalium-assay\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n82 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nTreatment\\nM. genitalium lacks a cell wall, and thus antibiotics targeting \\n\\ncell-wall biosynthesis (e.g., ß-lactams including penicillins and \\ncephalosporins) are ineffective against this organism. Because \\nof the high rates of macrolide resistance with treatment failures \\n(707) and efficient selection of additional resistance, a 1-g dose \\nof azithromycin should not be used.\\n\\nTwo-stage therapy approaches, ideally using resistance-\\nguided therapy, are recommended for treatment. Resistance-\\nguided therapy has demonstrated cure rates of >90% and \\nshould be used whenever possible (759,963); however, it \\nrequires access to macrolide-resistance testing. As part of this \\napproach, doxycycline is provided as initial empiric therapy, \\nwhich reduces the organism load and facilitates organism \\nclearance, followed by macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium \\ninfections treated with high-dose azithromycin; macrolide-\\nresistant infections are treated with moxifloxacin (964,965).\\n\\nRecommended Regimens if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is \\nAvailable\\n\\nIf macrolide sensitive: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for \\n7 days, followed by azithromycin 1 g orally initial dose, followed by \\n500 mg orally daily for 3 additional days (2.5 g total)\\n\\nIf macrolide resistant: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days \\nfollowed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days\\n\\nRecommended Regimen if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is \\nNot Available\\n\\nIf M. genitalium is detected by an FDA-cleared NAAT: Doxycycline \\n100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg \\norally once daily for 7 days\\n\\nAlthough the majority of M. genitalium strains are sensitive \\nto moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and adverse \\nside effects and cost should be considered with this regimen. \\nIn settings without access to resistance testing and when \\nmoxifloxacin cannot be used, an alternative regimen can be \\nconsidered, based on limited data: doxycycline 100 mg orally \\n2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin (1 g orally \\non day 1 followed by 500 mg once daily for 3 days) and a test \\nof cure 21 days after completion of therapy (963). Because of \\nthe high prevalence of macrolide resistance and high likelihood \\nof treatment failure, this regimen should be used only when \\na test of cure is possible, and no other alternatives exist. If \\nsymptomatic treatment failure or a positive test of cure occurs \\nafter this regimen, expert consultation is recommended. \\nData are limited regarding use of minocycline in instances of \\ntreatment failure (966).\\n\\nRecommended PID treatment regimens are not effective \\nagainst M. genitalium. Initial empiric therapy for PID, which \\nincludes doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days, \\nshould be provided at the time of presentation for care. If \\n\\nM. genitalium is detected, a regimen of moxifloxacin 400 mg \\norally once daily for 14 days has been effective in eradicating the \\norganism. Nevertheless, no data have been published that assess \\nthe benefits of testing women with PID for M. genitalium, and \\nthe importance of directing treatment against this organism \\nis unknown.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nTest of cure is not recommended for asymptomatic persons \\n\\nwho received treatment with a recommended regimen. In \\nsettings in which M. genitalium testing is available, persons \\nwith persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or PID accompanied by \\ndetection of M. genitalium should be treated with moxifloxacin.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nRecent studies report a high concordance of M. genitalium \\n\\namong partners of males, females, and MSM; however, no \\nstudies have determined whether reinfection is reduced with \\npartner treatment (940,967,968). Sex partners of patients \\nwith symptomatic M. genitalium infection can be tested, and \\nthose with a positive test can be treated to possibly reduce the \\nrisk for reinfection. If testing the partner is not possible, the \\nantimicrobial regimen that was provided to the patient can \\nbe provided.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\nHIV Infection\\n\\nPersons who have M. genitalium and HIV infection should \\nreceive the same treatment regimen as those persons without HIV.\\n\\nDiseases Characterized by \\nVulvovaginal Itching, Burning, \\nIrritation, Odor, or Discharge\\n\\nThe majority of women will have a vaginal infection, \\ncharacterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during \\ntheir lifetime. With the availability of complementary and \\nalternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for \\ncandidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products \\nbefore or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider.\\n\\nObtaining a medical history alone has been reported to \\nbe insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can \\nlead to inappropriate administration of medication (969). \\nTherefore, a careful history, examination, and laboratory \\ntesting to determine the etiology of any vaginal symptoms \\nare warranted. Information regarding sexual behaviors and \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 83US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\npractices, sex of sex partners, menses, vaginal hygiene practices \\n(e.g., douching), and self-treatment with oral and intravaginal \\nmedications or other products should be elicited. The \\ninfections most frequently associated with vaginal symptoms \\nare BV (i.e., replacement of the vaginal flora by an overgrowth \\nof anaerobic bacteria including G. vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, \\nA. vaginae, Megasphaera type 1, and numerous other fastidious \\nor uncultivated anaerobes), trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal \\ncandidiasis (VVC). Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal \\nvaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually \\ntransmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently \\ndiagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are \\nbeing evaluated for an STI.\\n\\nMultiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the \\netiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can \\nidentify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is \\ndiscussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to \\neach condition. In the clinician’s office, the cause of vaginal \\nsymptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium \\nhydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet \\nmount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the \\nvaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated \\npH (i.e., >4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although \\ntrichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). \\nBecause pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge \\nshould be further examined microscopically by first diluting \\none sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on \\none slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples \\nthat emit an amine odor immediately upon application of \\nKOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then \\nplaced on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope \\nat low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might \\ndisplay motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e., epithelial cells \\nwith borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which \\nare characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used \\nto identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. \\nHowever, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements \\nin KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the \\nsensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with \\nNAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast) (670). Presence of \\nWBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also \\nindicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).\\n\\nIn settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy \\nare unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, \\ndescribed in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be \\nused. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation \\nin the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing \\nindicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or \\n\\nother noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. \\nFor women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, \\nreferral to a specialist should be considered.\\n\\nBacterial Vaginosis\\nBV is a vaginal dysbiosis resulting from replacement of normal \\n\\nhydrogen peroxide and lactic-acid–producing Lactobacillus \\nspecies in the vagina with high concentrations of anaerobic \\nbacteria, including G. vaginalis, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus \\nspecies, A. vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. A notable \\nfeature is the appearance of a polymicrobial biofilm on vaginal \\nepithelial cells (970). Certain women experience transient \\nvaginal microbial changes, whereas others experience them for \\nlonger intervals (971). BV is a highly prevalent condition and \\nthe most common cause of vaginal discharge worldwide (972). \\nHowever, in a nationally representative survey, the majority of \\nwomen with BV were asymptomatic (310).\\n\\nBV is associated with having multiple male sex partners, \\nfemale partners, sexual relationships with more than one person \\n(973), a new sex partner, lack of condom use (974), douching \\n(975,976), and HSV-2 seropositivity (977). Male circumcision \\nreduces the risk for BV among women (978). In addition, BV \\nprevalence increases during menses (979,980). Women who \\nhave never been sexually active are rarely affected (981). The \\ncause of the microbial alteration that precipitates BV is not \\nfully understood, and whether BV results from acquisition \\nof a single sexually transmitted pathogen is unknown. BV \\nprevalence has been reported to increase among women with \\ncopper-containing IUDs (972,982). Hormonal contraception \\ndoes not increase risk for BV (983) and might protect against \\nBV development (983,984). Vitamin D deficiency has not \\nbeen reported to be a risk factor for BV (985).\\n\\nWomen with BV are at increased risk for STI acquisition, \\nsuch as HIV, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis \\n(977), M. genitalium (986), HPV (987), and HSV-2 (988); \\ncomplications after gynecologic surgery; complications of \\npregnancy; and recurrence of BV (971,989–991). BV also \\nincreases HIV infection acquisition (992) because specific \\nBV-associated bacteria can increase susceptibility to HIV \\n(993,994) and the risk for HIV transmission to male \\nsex partners (187). Evaluation of short-term valacyclovir \\nsuppression among women with HSV-2 did not decrease the \\nrisk for BV, despite effective suppression of HSV-2 (995).\\n\\nAlthough BV-associated bacteria can be identified on male \\ngenitalia (996,997), treatment of male sex partners has not been \\nbeneficial in preventing the recurrence of BV (998). Among \\nWSW, a high level of BV concordance occurs between sex \\npartners (292); however, no studies have evaluated treatment \\nof female sex partners of WSW to prevent BV recurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n84 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nBV can be diagnosed by using clinical criteria (i.e., \\n\\nAmsel’s diagnostic criteria) (999) or by determining the \\nNugent score from a vaginal Gram stain (1000). Vaginal \\nGram stain, considered the reference standard laboratory \\nmethod for diagnosing BV, is used to determine the relative \\nconcentration of lactobacilli (i.e., long gram-positive rods), \\nsmall gram-negative and gram-variable rods (i.e., G. vaginalis or \\nBacteroides), and curved gram-negative rods (i.e., Mobiluncus) \\ncharacteristic of BV. A Nugent score of 0–3 is consistent with \\na Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal microbiota, 4–6 with \\nintermediate microbiota (emergence of G. vaginalis), and 7–10 \\nwith BV. Clinical diagnosis of BV by Amsel criteria requires at \\nleast three of the following four symptoms or signs:\\n\\n• Homogeneous, thin discharge (milklike consistency) that \\nsmoothly coats the vaginal walls\\n\\n• Clue cells (e.g., vaginal epithelial cells studded with \\nadherent bacteria) on microscopic examination\\n\\n• pH of vaginal fluid >4.5\\n• A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition \\n\\nof 10% KOH (i.e., the whiff test)\\nDetection of at least three Amsel criteria has been correlated \\n\\nwith results by Gram stain (1001). The sensitivity and \\nspecificity of the Amsel criteria are 37%–70% and 94%–99%, \\nrespectively, compared with the Nugent score (1002).\\n\\nIn addition to the Amsel criteria, multiple POC tests are \\navailable for BV diagnosis. The Osom BV Blue test (Sekisui \\nDiagnostics) detects vaginal sialidase activity (1003,1004). \\nThe Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson) is an oligonucleotide \\nprobe test that detects high concentrations of G. vaginalis \\nnucleic acids (>5 x 105 CFU of G. vaginalis/mL of vaginal \\nfluid) for diagnosing BV, Candida species, and T. vaginalis. \\nThis test has been reported to be most useful for symptomatic \\nwomen in conjunction with vaginal pH measurement and \\npresence of amine odor (sensitivity of 97%); specificity is \\n81% compared with Nugent. Finally, the FemExam Test \\nCard (Cooper Surgical) measures vaginal pH, presence of \\ntrimethylamine (a metabolic by-product of G. vaginalis), \\nand proline aminopeptidase (1005). Sensitivity is 91% and \\nspecificity is 61%, compared with Nugent. This test has \\nprimarily been studied in resource-poor settings (1005), and \\nalthough it has been reported to be beneficial compared with \\nsyndromic management, it is not a preferred diagnostic method \\nfor BV diagnosis.\\n\\nMultiple BV NAATs are available for BV diagnosis among \\nsymptomatic women (1002). These tests are based on detection \\nof specific bacterial nucleic acids and have high sensitivity \\nand specificity for BV (i.e., G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, BVAB2, \\nor Megasphaera type 1) (1006) and certain lactobacilli (i.e., \\n\\nLactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus \\ngasseri). They can be performed on either clinician- or self-\\ncollected vaginal specimens with results available in <24 hours, \\ndepending on the availability of the molecular diagnostic \\nplatform (1002). Five quantitative multiplex PCR assays are \\navailable: Max Vaginal Panel (Becton Dickinson) (1007), \\nAptima BV (Hologic), NuSwab VG (LabCorp) (1008), \\nOneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by qPCR \\n(Medical Diagnostic Laboratories) (1009), and SureSwab BV \\n(Quest Diagnostics). Two of these assays are FDA cleared (BD \\nMax Vaginal Panel and Aptima BV), and the other three are \\nlaboratory-developed tests.\\n\\nThe Max Vaginal Panel provides results by an algorithmic \\nanalysis of molecular DNA detection of Lactobacillus species \\n(L. crispatus and L. jensenii) in addition to G. vaginalis, \\nA. vaginae, BVAB2, and Megasphaera type 1. This test has \\n90.5% sensitivity and 85.8% specificity for BV diagnosis, \\ncompared with Amsel criteria and Nugent score. It also provides \\nresults for Candida species and T. vaginalis. The Aptima BV \\ndetects G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and certain Lactobacillus species \\nincluding L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri, with sensitivity \\nand specificity ranging from 95.0% to 97.3% and 85.8% to \\n89.6%, respectively (using either clinician- or patient-collected \\nvaginal swabs). The three laboratory-developed tests (NuSwab \\nVG, OneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by \\nqPCR, and SureSwab BV) have to be internally validated before \\nuse for patient care yet have good sensitivity and specificity, \\nsimilar to FDA-cleared assays. BV NAATs should be used \\namong symptomatic women only (e.g., women with vaginal \\ndischarge, odor, or itch) because their accuracy is not well \\ndefined for asymptomatic women. Despite the availability of \\nBV NAATs, traditional methods of BV diagnosis, including \\nthe Amsel criteria, Nugent score, and the Affirm VP III assay, \\nremain useful for diagnosing symptomatic BV because of their \\nlower cost and ability to provide a rapid diagnosis. Culture of \\nG. vaginalis is not recommended as a diagnostic tool because \\nit is not specific. Cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for \\ndiagnosing BV because of their low sensitivity and specificity.\\n\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for BV is recommended for women with \\n\\nsymptoms. Established benefits of therapy among nonpregnant \\nwomen are to relieve vaginal symptoms and signs of infection. \\nOther potential benefits of treatment include reduction \\nin the risk for acquiring C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, \\nT. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HIV, HPV, and HSV-2 (971,986–\\n988,990,1010). No data are available that directly compare \\nthe efficacy of oral and topical medications for treating BV.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 85US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Bacterial Vaginosis\\n\\nMetronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\nor\\n\\nMetronidazole gel 0.75% one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally, once \\ndaily for 5 days\\n\\nor\\nClindamycin cream 2% one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally at \\nbedtime for 7 days\\n\\nA review regarding alcohol consumption during \\nmetronidazole treatment reported no in vitro studies, animal \\nmodels, reports of adverse effects, or clinical studies providing \\nconvincing evidence of a disulfiram-like interaction between \\nalcohol and metronidazole (1011).

In a phase 3 clinical trial of metronidazole 1.3% vaginal \\ngel versus placebo, BV clinical cure rates at day 21 were 37.2% \\nin the metronidazole 1.3% vaginal gel arm, compared with \\n26.6% in the placebo arm (p = 0.01) (1018). A patient savings \\ncard for metronidazole 1.3% vaginal gel is available at https://\\nnuvessa.com/nuvessa_files/19_Nuvessa_WEB_Card_032819.\\npdf. In a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, parallel-\\ngroup study of Clindesse 2% vaginal cream single dose versus \\nclindamycin 2% vaginal cream at bedtime for 7 days among \\n540 women with BV, no statistically significant difference \\nexisted between groups in clinical cure at days 21–30 (64.3% \\nversus 63.2%; p = 0.95) (1019); however, this study had \\nmethodologic problems. A patient savings card for Clindesse \\n2% vaginal cream is available at https://www.clindesse.com/\\npdf/CLINDESSE_SavingsCard.pdf.\\n\\nBV biofilm disrupting agents (i.e., TOL-463) (1020) are \\nbeing investigated to determine their role in enhancing the \\nlikelihood of BV cure relative to approved therapies. Studies \\nhave evaluated the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of \\nintravaginal Lactobacillus and other probiotic formulations to \\ntreat BV and restore normal vaginal microbiota (1021–1025); \\noverall, no studies support these products as an adjunctive or \\nreplacement therapy for women with BV.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAll women with BV should be tested for HIV and other STIs.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nFollow-up visits are unnecessary if symptoms resolve.

Using a different recommended \\ntreatment regimen can be considered for women who have a \\nrecurrence; however, retreatment with the same recommended \\nregimen is an acceptable approach for treating persistent or \\nrecurrent BV after the first occurrence (1026). For women with \\nmultiple recurrences after completion of a recommended regimen, \\neither 0.75% metronidazole gel or 750 mg metronidazole vaginal \\nsuppository twice weekly for >3 months has been reported to \\nreduce recurrences, although this benefit does not persist when \\n\\nhttps://www.solosec.com/savings-card\\nhttps://www.solosec.com/savings-card\\nhttps://www.clindesse.com/pdf/CLINDESSE_SavingsCard.pdf\\nhttps://www.clindesse.com/pdf/CLINDESSE_SavingsCard.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n86 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nsuppressive therapy is discontinued (1027,1028). Limited data \\nindicate that for women with multiple recurrences, an oral \\nnitroimidazole (metronidazole or tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/\\nday for 7 days), followed by intravaginal boric acid 600 mg \\ndaily for 21 days and suppressive 0.75% metronidazole gel \\ntwice weekly for 4–6 months, might be an option for women \\nwith recurrent BV (1029). Monthly oral metronidazole 2 g \\nadministered with fluconazole 150 mg has also been evaluated \\nas suppressive therapy; this regimen reduced the BV incidence \\nand promoted colonization with normal vaginal microbiota \\n(1030). A randomized controlled trial of a dendrimer-based \\nmicrobicide 1% vaginal gel (Astodrimer) also reported favorable \\nresults in prolonging the time to BV recurrence, compared with \\nplacebo (1031). In addition, a clinical trial of L. crispatus CTV-05 \\n(Lactin-V), administered vaginally in 4 consecutive daily doses \\nfor 4 days in week 1 followed by twice weekly doses for 10 weeks \\n(after initial treatment with 5 days of 0.75% vaginal metronidazole \\ngel), reported a substantially lower incidence of BV recurrence at \\n12 weeks in the Lactin-V arm, compared with placebo (1032); \\nhowever this medication is not yet FDA cleared or commercially \\navailable. High-dose Vitamin D supplementation has not been \\ndetermined to decrease BV recurrence in randomized controlled \\ntrials (1033) and is not recommended.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nData from earlier clinical trials indicate that a woman’s \\n\\nresponse to therapy and the likelihood of relapse or \\nrecurrence are not affected by treatment of her sex partner \\n(998). Therefore, routine treatment of sex partners is not \\nrecommended. However, a pilot study reported that male \\npartner treatment (i.e., metronidazole 400 mg orally 2 times/\\nday in conjunction with 2% clindamycin cream applied \\ntopically to the penile skin 2 times/day for 7 days) of women \\nwith recurrent BV had an immediate and sustained effect on \\nthe composition of the vaginal microbiota, with an overall \\ndecrease in bacterial diversity at day 28 (1034). Male partner \\ntreatment also had an immediate effect on the composition of \\nthe penile microbiota; however, this was not as pronounced \\nat day 28, compared with that among women. A phase 3 \\nmulticenter randomized double-blinded trial evaluating the \\nefficacy of a 7-day oral metronidazole regimen versus placebo \\nfor treatment of male sex partners of women with recurrent \\nBV did not find that male partner treatment reduced BV \\nrecurrence in female partners, although women whose male \\npartners adhered to multidose metronidazole were less likely \\nto experience treatment failure (1035).\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions\\nIntravaginal clindamycin cream is preferred in case of allergy \\n\\nor intolerance to metronidazole or tinidazole. Intravaginal \\nmetronidazole gel can be considered for women who are not \\nallergic to metronidazole but do not tolerate oral metronidazole.\\n\\nPregnancy\\nBV treatment is recommended for all symptomatic pregnant \\n\\nwomen because symptomatic BV has been associated with \\nadverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature rupture \\nof membranes, preterm birth, intra-amniotic infection, and \\npostpartum endometritis (989,991,1036). Studies have been \\nundertaken to determine the efficacy of BV treatment among \\nthis population, including two trials demonstrating that oral \\nmetronidazole was efficacious during pregnancy by using \\nthe 250 mg 3 times/day regimen (1037,1038); however, oral \\nmetronidazole administered as a 500 mg 2 times/day regimen \\ncan also be used. One trial involving a limited number of \\nparticipants revealed treatment with oral metronidazole \\n500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days to be equally effective as \\nmetronidazole gel 0.75% for 5 days, with cure rates of 70% \\nby using Amsel criteria to define cure (1039). Another trial \\ndemonstrated a cure rate of 85% by using Gram-stain criteria \\nafter treatment with oral clindamycin 300 mg 2 times/day for \\n7 days (1040–1043).\\n\\nAlthough older studies indicated a possible link between \\nusing vaginal clindamycin during pregnancy and adverse \\noutcomes for the newborn, newer data demonstrate that \\nthis treatment approach is safe for pregnant women (1044). \\nAlthough metronidazole crosses the placenta, no evidence of \\nteratogenicity or mutagenic effects among infants has been \\nreported in multiple cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort \\nstudies of pregnant women (1041–1043). These data indicate \\nthat metronidazole therapy poses low risk during pregnancy. \\nData from human studies are limited regarding the use of \\ntinidazole in pregnancy; however, animal data demonstrate \\nthat such therapy poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should \\nbe avoided during pregnancy (431). Data are insufficient \\nregarding efficacy and adverse effects of secnidazole, Clindesse \\n2% vaginal cream, metronidazole 1.3% vaginal gel, and \\n750-mg vaginal metronidazole tablets during pregnancy; thus, \\ntheir use should be avoided.\\n\\nOral therapy has not been reported to be superior to topical \\ntherapy for treating symptomatic BV in effecting cure or \\npreventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Pregnant women \\ncan be treated with any of the recommended regimens for \\nnonpregnant women, in addition to the alternative regimens \\nof oral clindamycin and clindamycin ovules.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 87US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nTreatment of asymptomatic BV among pregnant women \\nat high risk for preterm delivery (i.e., those with a previous \\npreterm birth or late miscarriage) has been evaluated by \\nmultiple studies, which have yielded mixed results. Seven \\ntrials have evaluated treatment of pregnant women with \\nasymptomatic BV at high risk for preterm delivery: one revealed \\nharm (1045), two reported no benefit (1046,1047), and four \\ndemonstrated benefit (1037,1038,1048,1049).\\n\\nTreatment of asymptomatic BV among pregnant women \\nat low risk for preterm delivery has not been reported to \\nreduce adverse outcomes of pregnancy in a large multicenter \\nrandomized controlled trial (1050). Therefore, routine \\nscreening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at \\nhigh or low risk for preterm delivery for preventing preterm \\nbirth is not recommended.\\n\\nMetronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal \\noral therapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses \\nthat are less than those used to treat infections among infants, \\nalthough the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. \\nPlasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable \\nbut remain less than maternal plasma levels (https://www.\\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/?report=classic). \\nAlthough multiple reported case series identified no evidence \\nof metronidazole-associated adverse effects for breastfed \\ninfants, certain clinicians recommend deferring breastfeeding \\nfor 12–24 hours after maternal treatment with a single 2-g \\ndose of metronidazole (1051). Lower doses produce a lower \\nconcentration in breast milk and are considered compatible \\nwith breastfeeding (1052,1053).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nBV appears to recur with higher frequency among women \\n\\nwho have HIV infection (1054). Women with HIV infection \\nand BV should receive the same treatment regimen as those \\nwho do not have HIV.\\n\\nTrichomoniasis\\nTrichomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral \\n\\nSTI worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons \\nin the United States (838,1055). Because trichomoniasis is \\nnot a reportable disease (1056), and no recommendations are \\navailable for general screening for T. vaginalis, the epidemiology \\nof trichomoniasis has largely come from population-based and \\nclinic-based surveillance studies. The U.S. population-based \\nT. vaginalis prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among \\nmales, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6%) \\nand Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White \\nwomen (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%) (1057,1058). \\nUnlike chlamydia and gonorrhea, T. vaginalis prevalence \\n\\nrates are as high among women aged >24 years as they are \\nfor women aged <24 years (1057). Among persons attending \\nnine geographically diverse STD clinics, the trichomonas \\nprevalence was 14.6% among women (1059), and a study \\nof STD clinic attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified \\na prevalence of 27% among women and 9.8% among men \\n(1060). Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of \\ninfection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%) (1061). \\nRates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at \\n9%–32% of incarcerated women (386,387,391,392,1062) and \\n3.2%–8% of incarcerated men (388). Women with a history of \\nincarceration are two to five times more likely to have T. vaginalis \\n(387,388,1063,1064). Other risk factors for T. vaginalis include \\nhaving two or more sex partners during the previous year, having \\nless than a high school education, and living below the national \\npoverty level (1065). Women with BV are at higher risk for \\nT. vaginalis (1066). Male partners of women with trichomoniasis \\nare likely to have infection (1067), although the prevalence of \\ntrichomoniasis among MSM is low (179,1068).\\n\\nThe majority of persons who have trichomoniasis \\n(70%–85%) either have minimal or no genital symptoms, \\nand untreated infections might last from months to years \\n(137,1069,1070). Men with trichomoniasis sometimes have \\nsymptoms of urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis, and women \\nwith trichomoniasis sometimes have vaginal discharge, which \\ncan be diffuse, malodorous, or yellow-green with or without \\nvulvar irritation, and might have a strawberry-appearing cervix, \\nwhich is observed more often on colposcopy than on physical \\nexamination (1071). Although many persons might be unaware \\nof their infection, it is readily passed between sex partners \\nduring penile-vaginal sex (1072) or through transmission of \\ninfected vaginal fluids or fomites among women who have sex \\nwith women (275,294).\\n\\nAmong persons who are sexually active, the best way to \\nprevent genital trichomoniasis is through consistent and correct \\nuse of condoms (external or internal) (18). Partners of men \\nwho have been circumcised might have a somewhat reduced \\nrisk for T. vaginalis infection (1072,1073). Douching is not \\nrecommended because it might increase the risk for vaginal \\ninfections, including trichomoniasis (1074).\\n\\nT. vaginalis causes reproductive morbidity and has been \\nreported to be associated with a 1.4-times greater likelihood \\nof preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and \\ninfants who are small for gestational age (1075). T. vaginalis \\nwas also determined to be associated with a 2.1-fold increased \\nrisk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis (1076). Another \\nmeta-analysis of six studies reported a slightly elevated but \\nnot statistically significant association between T. vaginalis and \\nprostate cancer (1077).\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/?report=classic\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/?report=classic\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n88 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nT. vaginalis infection is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk \\nfor HIV acquisition and is associated with an increase in HIV \\nvaginal shedding, which is reduced with T. vaginalis treatment \\namong women without viral suppression (1078,1079). Among \\nwomen with HIV infection, T. vaginalis infection is associated \\nwith increased risk for PID (1080–1082).\\n\\nDiagnostic testing for T. vaginalis should be performed for \\nwomen seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening \\nmight be considered for persons receiving care in high-\\nprevalence settings (e.g., STD clinics and correctional facilities) \\nand for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection (e.g., \\nmultiple sex partners, transactional sex, drug misuse, or a \\nhistory of STIs or incarceration). However, data are lacking \\nregarding whether screening and treatment for asymptomatic \\ntrichomoniasis in high-prevalence settings for women at high \\nrisk can reduce any adverse health events and health disparities \\nor reduce community infection burden. Decisions about \\nscreening can be guided by local epidemiology of T. vaginalis \\ninfection. Routine annual screening for T. vaginalis among \\nasymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended \\nbecause of these adverse events associated with trichomoniasis \\nand HIV infection.\\n\\nExtragenital T. vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon \\ncompared with genital infections. A study of 500 men in San \\nFrancisco, California, reported a 0.6% rate of rectal T. vaginalis \\n(1083); however, this might reflect deposition of T. vaginalis \\nDNA and not necessarily active infection. Few studies of \\nextragenital T. vaginalis among women have been published. \\nThe efficacy, benefit, and cost-effectiveness of extragenital \\nscreening are unknown, and no tests are FDA cleared for \\nextragenital testing; therefore, rectal and oral testing for \\nT. vaginalis is not recommended.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nWet-mount microscopy traditionally has been used as \\n\\nthe preferred diagnostic test for T. vaginalis among women \\nbecause it is inexpensive and can be performed at the POC; \\nhowever, it has low sensitivity (44%–68%) compared with \\nculture (1084–1086). To improve detection, clinicians using \\nwet mounts should attempt to evaluate slides immediately \\nafter specimen collection because sensitivity decreases quickly \\nto 20% within 1 hour after collection (1087). More highly \\nsensitive and specific molecular diagnostic options are available, \\nwhich should be used in conjunction with a negative wet \\nmount when possible.\\n\\nNAATs are highly sensitive, detecting more T. vaginalis \\ninfections than wet-mount microscopy among women \\n(1060). The Aptima T. vaginalis assay (Beckton Dickinson) is \\nFDA cleared for detection of T. vaginalis from symptomatic \\nor asymptomatic women. Reliable samples include \\n\\nclinician-collected endocervical swabs, clinician-collected \\nvaginal swabs, female urine specimens, and liquid Pap \\nsmear specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution (Hologic) \\n(698,1088). This assay detects RNA by transcription-\\nmediated amplification with a sensitivity of 95.3%–100% \\nand specificity of 95.2%–100%, compared with wet mount \\nand culture (1088,1089). Among women, vaginal swabs and \\nurine specimens have <100% concordance (1084). This assay \\nhas not been FDA cleared for use among men and should be \\ninternally validated in accordance with CLIA regulations before \\nuse with urine or urethral swabs from men. The Probe Tec TV \\nQx Amplified DNA Assay (Becton Dickinson) is FDA cleared \\nfor detection of T. vaginalis from vaginal (patient-collected \\nor clinician-collected) swabs, endocervical swabs, or urine \\nspecimens from women and has sensitivity of 98.3% and \\nspecificity of 99.6%, compared with wet mount and culture \\n(1090). Similar to the Aptima T. vaginalis assay, this test is only \\nFDA cleared for use among women and should be internally \\nvalidated for use with men. The Max CTGCTV2 assay (Becton \\nDickinson) is also FDA cleared for detection of T. vaginalis in \\npatient-collected or clinician-collected vaginal swab specimens \\nand male and female urine specimens, with sensitivity and \\nspecificity of 96.2%–100% and 99.1%–100%, respectively, \\ndepending on the specimen type, compared with wet mount \\nand culture (1091). GeneXpert TV (Cepheid) is a moderately \\ncomplex rapid test that can be performed in ≤1 hour and can be \\nused at the POC (1092). It has been FDA cleared for use with \\nfemale urine specimens, endocervical swabs, patient-collected \\nor clinician-collected vaginal specimens, and male urine \\nspecimens, with sensitivity and specificity of 99.5%–100% \\nand 99.4%–99.9% (1007), respectively, compared with wet \\nmount and culture.\\n\\nMultiple FDA-cleared rapid tests are available for detecting \\nT. vaginalis with improved sensitivities and specificities, \\ncompared with wet mount. The Osom trichomonas rapid \\ntest (Sekisui Diagnostics) is an antigen-detection test that uses \\nimmunochromatographic capillary flow dipstick technology \\nthat can be performed at the POC by using clinician-obtained \\nvaginal specimens. Results are available in approximately \\n10–15 minutes, with sensitivities of 82%–95% and specificity \\nof 97%–100%, compared with wet mount, culture, and \\ntranscription-mediated amplification (1089,1093,1094). A \\nstudy of 209 women aged 14–22 years reported that >99% \\ncould correctly perform and interpret a vaginal self-test by \\nusing the Osom assay, with a high correlation with clinician \\ninterpretation (96% agreement; κ\\xa0=\\xa00.87) (1094). The Osom \\ntest should not be used with men because of low sensitivity \\n(38% compared with Aptima) (1095). The Solana trichomonas \\nassay (Quidel) is another rapid test for the qualitative detection \\nof T. vaginalis DNA and can yield results <40 minutes after \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 89US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nspecimen collection. This assay is FDA cleared for diagnosing \\nT. vaginalis from female vaginal and urine specimens from \\nasymptomatic and symptomatic women with sensitivity >98%, \\ncompared with NAAT for vaginal specimens, and >92% for \\nurine specimens (1096). The Amplivue trichomonas assay \\n(Quidel) is another rapid test providing qualitative detection \\nof T. vaginalis that has been FDA cleared for vaginal specimens \\nfrom symptomatic and asymptomatic women, with sensitivity \\nof 90.7% and specificity of 98.9%, compared with NAAT \\n(1097). Neither the Osom assay nor the Affirm VP III test is \\nFDA cleared for use with specimens from men.\\n\\nCulture, such as the InPouch system (BioMed Diagnostics), \\nwas considered the most sensitive method for diagnosing \\nT. vaginalis infection before molecular detection methods \\nbecame available. Culture has sensitivity of 44%–75% and \\nspecificity of <100% (698,1086,1098). For women, vaginal \\nsecretions are the preferred specimen type for culture because \\nurine culture is less sensitive (698,1099,1100). For men, \\nculture specimens require a urethral swab, urine sediment, \\nor semen. To improve diagnostic yield, multiple specimens \\nfrom men can be used to inoculate a single culture. Cultures \\nrequire an incubator and are necessary for T. vaginalis drug \\nsusceptibility testing. The InPouch specimen should be \\nexamined daily for 5 days over a 7-day period to reduce the \\npossibility of false negatives (1101).\\n\\nAlthough T. vaginalis might be an incidental finding on a \\nPap test, neither conventional nor liquid-based Pap smears \\nare considered diagnostic tests for trichomoniasis; however, \\nwomen with T. vaginalis identified on a Pap smear should be \\nretested with sensitive diagnostic tests and treated if infection \\nis confirmed (1102,1103).\\n\\nTreatment\\nTreatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis \\n\\ninfection and might reduce transmission. Treatment \\nrecommendations for women are based on a meta-analysis \\n(1104) and a multicenter, randomized trial of mostly \\nsymptomatic women without HIV infection (1105). The \\nstudy demonstrated that multidose metronidazole (500 mg \\norally 2 times/day for 7 days) reduced the proportion of \\nwomen retesting positive at a 1-month test of cure visit by half, \\ncompared with women who received the 2-g single dose.No \\npublished randomized trials are available that compare these \\ndoses among men.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Women \\n\\nMetronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Men \\n\\nMetronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose\\n\\nAlternative Regimen for Women and Men\\n\\nTinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose\\n\\nThe nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with \\nclinically demonstrated efficacy against T. vaginalis infections. \\nTinidazole is usually more expensive, reaches higher levels in \\nserum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than \\nmetronidazole (12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer \\ngastrointestinal side effects (1106,1107). In randomized \\nclinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have \\nresulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98% (1108), \\nand the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure \\nrates of approximately 92%–100% (1108–1112). Randomized \\ncontrolled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole \\nand tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior \\nto metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom \\nresolution (1110,1113,1114).\\n\\nMetronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the \\nurethra and perivaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious \\nthan oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nProviders should advise persons with T. vaginalis infections \\n\\nto abstain from sex until they and their sex partners are treated \\n(i.e., when therapy has been completed and any symptoms \\nhave resolved). Testing for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, \\ngonorrhea, and chlamydia, should be performed for persons \\nwith T. vaginalis.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nBecause of the high rate of reinfection among women treated \\n\\nfor trichomoniasis, retesting for T. vaginalis is recommended \\nfor all sexually active women <3 months after initial treatment \\nregardless of whether they believe their sex partners were \\ntreated (137,1115). If retesting at 3 months is not possible, \\nclinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical \\ncare <12 months after initial treatment. Data are insufficient \\nto support retesting men after treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nConcurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for \\n\\npreventing reinfections. Current partners should be referred \\nfor presumptive therapy. Partners also should be advised to \\nabstain from intercourse until they and their sex partners \\nhave been treated and any symptoms have resolved. EPT \\nmight have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis \\n(129,1116) and can be used in states where permissible by law \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/std/ept/legal/default.htm); however, no \\npartner management intervention has been demonstrated to \\nbe superior in reducing reinfection rates (129,130). Although \\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/ept/legal/default.htm\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n90 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nno definitive data exist to guide treatment for partners of \\npersons with persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis among \\nwhom nonadherence and reinfection are unlikely, partners \\nmight benefit from being evaluated and receiving treatment \\n(see Recurrent Trichomoniasis).\\n\\nRecurrent Trichomoniasis\\nA recurrent infection can result from treatment failure \\n\\n(antimicrobial-resistant T. vaginalis or host-related problems), \\nlack of adherence, or reinfection from an untreated sex partner. \\nIn the case of a recurrent infection, the origin of the repeat \\ninfection should be assessed because most recurrent infections \\nlikely result from reinfection. Retesting can be considered in \\ncases of persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis with culture, the \\npreferred test. If NAAT is used, it should not be conducted before \\n3 weeks after treatment completion because of possible detection \\nof residual nucleic acid that is not clinically relevant (1117).\\n\\nThe nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobials \\nknown to be effective against trichomonas infection. \\nMetronidazole resistance occurs in 4%–10% of cases of \\nvaginal trichomoniasis (1116,1118). Tinidazole resistance \\nis less well studied but was present in 1% of infections in \\none study (1116). Overall, more T. vaginalis isolates have \\nreported susceptibility to tinidazole than metronidazole (1119). \\nMultidose oral metronidazole is more effective than single-dose \\ntreatment, particularly for women who are symptomatic or \\nhave a history of T. vaginalis (1120).\\n\\nNitroimidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is concerning \\nbecause few alternatives to standard therapy exist. If treatment \\nfailure occurs in a woman after completing a regimen of \\nmetronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days and she has been \\nreexposed to an untreated partner, a repeat course of the same \\nregimen is recommended. If no reexposure has occurred, she \\nshould be treated with metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g once \\ndaily for 7 days. If a man has persistent T. vaginalis after a \\nsingle 2-g dose of metronidazole and has been reexposed to \\nan untreated partner, he should be retreated with a single 2-g \\ndose of metronidazole. If he has not been reexposed, he should \\nbe administered a course of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/\\nday for 7 days.\\n\\nFor persons who are experiencing persistent infection \\nnot attributable to reexposure, clinicians should request a \\nkit from CDC to perform drug-resistance testing (https://\\nwww.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.\\nhtml?CDCTestCode=CDC-10239). CDC is experienced with \\nsusceptibility testing for nitroimidazole-resistant T. vaginalis \\nand can provide guidance regarding treatment in cases of \\ndrug resistance. On the basis of drug resistance testing, an \\nalternative treatment regimen might be recommended. \\nTreatments for infections demonstrating in vitro resistance \\n\\ncan include metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g daily for 7 days. \\nIf a patient has treatment failure after the 7-day regimen of \\nhigh-dose oral metronidazole or tinidazole, two additional \\ntreatment options have been determined to have successful \\nresults for women. The first is high-dose oral tinidazole \\n2 g daily plus intravaginal tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for \\n14 days (1121). If this regimen fails, high-dose oral tinidazole \\n(1 g 3 times/day) plus intravaginal paromomycin (4 g of 6.25% \\nintravaginal paromomycin cream nightly) for 14 days should \\nbe considered (1122).\\n\\nAlternative regimens might be effective but have not been \\nsystemically evaluated; therefore, consultation with an infectious \\ndisease specialist is recommended. Clinical improvement has \\nbeen reported with intravaginal boric acid (1123,1124) but \\nnot with nitazoxanide (1123–1125). The following topically \\napplied agents have minimal success (<50%) and are not \\nrecommended: intravaginal betadine (povidone-iodine), \\nclotrimazole, acetic acid, furazolidone, GV, nonoxynol-9, and \\npotassium permanganate (1126). No other topical microbicide \\nhas been reported to be effective against trichomoniasis.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\nMetronidazole and tinidazole are both nitroimidazoles. \\n\\nPatients with an IgE-mediated-type hypersensitivity reaction \\nto 5-nitroimidazole antimicrobials should be managed by \\nmetronidazole desensitization according to published regimens \\n(1127,1128) and in consultation with an allergy specialist. The \\noptimal treatment for patients with T. vaginalis who are unable \\nto be desensitized has not been systematically investigated and is \\nbased on case reports, some of which report using paromomycin \\nor boric acid for treating T. vaginalis (1123,1129).\\n\\nPregnancy\\nT. vaginalis infection among pregnant women is associated \\n\\nwith adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly premature \\nrupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and delivery of infants \\nwho are small for gestational age (1075). One randomized \\ntrial of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis \\nreported no substantial difference in preterm birth after \\ntreatment with 2 g of metronidazole 48 hours apart during \\n16–23 and 24–29 weeks’ gestation, compared with placebo \\n(1130). However, that trial had multiple limitations, including \\nuse of an atypical metronidazole regimen. Another multicenter \\nobservational study of asymptomatic pregnant women in sub-\\nSahara African, the majority with HIV infection, reported \\nneither trichomoniasis nor its treatment appeared to influence \\nthe risk for preterm birth or a low-birthweight infant (1131).\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10239\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10239\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10239\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 91US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nAlthough metronidazole crosses the placenta, data indicate \\nthat it poses a low risk to the developing fetus (1040,1042,1132). \\nNo evidence of teratogenicity or mutagenic effects among \\ninfants has been found in multiple cross-sectional and cohort \\nstudies among pregnant women examining single-dose (2 g) \\nand multidose metronidazole regimens (1040,1131–1135).\\n\\nSymptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage, \\nshould be tested and treated. Treatment of T. vaginalis infection \\ncan relieve symptoms of vaginal discharge for pregnant women \\nand reduce sexual transmission to partners. Although perinatal \\ntransmission of trichomoniasis is uncommon, treatment \\nmight also prevent respiratory or genital infection in the \\nnewborn (1136,1137). Clinicians should counsel symptomatic \\npregnant women with trichomoniasis about the potential \\nrisks and benefits of treatment and about the importance of \\npartner treatment and condom use in the prevention of sexual \\ntransmission. The benefit of routine screening for T. vaginalis \\nin asymptomatic pregnant women has not been established.\\n\\nMetronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal oral \\ntherapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses that \\nare lower than those used to treat infections among infants, \\nalthough the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. \\nPlasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but \\nremain less than maternal plasma levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.\\nnih.gov/books/NBK501922). Although multiple reported case \\nseries studies demonstrated no evidence of adverse effects among \\ninfants exposed to metronidazole in breast milk, clinicians \\nsometimes advise deferring breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after \\nmaternal treatment with metronidazole (1051). In one study, \\nmaternal treatment with metronidazole (400 mg 3 times/day \\nfor 7 days) produced a lower concentration in breast milk and \\nwas considered compatible with breastfeeding over longer \\nperiods (1052).\\n\\nData from studies involving human subjects are limited \\nregarding tinidazole use during pregnancy; however, animal data \\nindicate this drug poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should \\nbe avoided for pregnant women, and breastfeeding should be \\ndeferred for 72 hours after a single 2-g oral dose of tinidazole \\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nUp to 53% of women with HIV have T. vaginalis infection \\n\\n(1115,1138). T. vaginalis infection among these women is \\nsubstantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease \\n(1082). Among women who are not virally suppressed, \\ntreatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in \\ngenital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding (1079,1139); \\nhowever, no difference might occur among women who are \\nvirally suppressed (1140). Because of the high prevalence \\nof T. vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential \\n\\nfor adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and \\npossibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and \\nprompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV \\ninfection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at \\nleast annually thereafter.\\n\\nA randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV \\nand T. vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose \\nof metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg \\n2 times/day for 7 days (1105). Factors that might interfere \\nwith standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among \\nwomen with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV \\ninfection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired \\nimmunity (1141). Thus, to improve cure rates, women with \\nHIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection should \\nbe treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day \\nfor 7 days. For pregnant women with HIV, screening at \\nthe first prenatal visit and prompt treatment, as needed, are \\nrecommended because T. vaginalis infection is a risk factor for \\nvertical transmission of HIV (1142).\\n\\nTreatment\\nTreatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis \\n\\ninfection, cures infection, and might reduce transmission. \\nLikelihood of adverse outcomes among women with HIV \\ninfection is also reduced with T. vaginalis therapy.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Trichomonas and HIV Infection \\nAmong Women \\n\\nMetronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\n\\nIf a woman with HIV infection experiences treatment failure, the \\nprotocol outlined is recommended (see Recurrent Trichomonas). \\nOther management considerations, follow-up, and management \\nof sex partners should be performed as for women without HIV \\ninfection. Treatment of men with HIV infection should follow \\nthe same guidelines as for men without HIV.\\n\\nFor women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis \\ninfection, retesting is recommended 3 months after treatment; \\nNAAT is encouraged because of higher sensitivity of these \\ntests. Data are insufficient to support retesting of men with \\ntrichomonas and HIV infection.\\n\\nVulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nVVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can \\n\\noccasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. \\nTypical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, \\ndyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. \\nNone of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated \\n75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and \\n40%–45% will have two or more episodes.

Approximately 10%–20% of women \\nwill have complicated VVC, requiring special diagnostic and \\ntherapeutic considerations.\\n\\nUncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nA diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the \\n\\npresence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, \\nand redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, \\nand thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with \\nuncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. \\nThe diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and \\nsymptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, \\n10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding \\nyeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test \\nyields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is \\nassociated with normal vaginal pH (<4.5). Use of 10% KOH \\nin wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and \\nmycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure \\nthe yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with \\nKOH preparation should be performed for all women with \\n\\nsymptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result \\nshould be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but \\nexisting signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should \\nbe considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for \\nthese women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying \\nCandida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not \\nan indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% \\nof women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the \\nvagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA \\ncleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar \\nwith the performance characteristics of the specific test used. \\nYeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic \\nyeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.\\n\\nTreatment\\nShort-course topical formulations (i.e., single dose and \\n\\nregimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. \\nTreatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative \\ncultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy.\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\n\\nOver-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents\\nClotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days\\n\\nor\\nClotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days\\n\\nor\\nMiconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days\\n\\nor\\nMiconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days\\n\\nor\\nMiconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days\\n\\nor\\nMiconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days\\n\\nor\\nMiconazole 1,200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 1 day\\n\\nor\\nTioconazole 6.5% ointment 5 g intravaginally in a single application\\n\\nPrescription Intravaginal Agents\\nButoconazole 2% cream (single-dose bioadhesive product) 5 g \\nintravaginally in a single application\\n\\nor\\nTerconazole 0.4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days\\n\\nor\\nTerconazole 0.8% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days\\n\\nor\\nTerconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 3 days\\n\\nOral Agent\\nFluconazole 150 mg orally in a single dose\\n\\nThe creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil \\nbased and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. \\nPatients should refer to condom product labeling for further \\ninformation.

Unnecessary or unapproved use of over-the-counter \\npreparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment \\nof other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse \\noutcomes. No substantial evidence exists to support using \\nprobiotics or homeopathic medications for treating VVC.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nFollow-up typically is not required. However, women with \\n\\npersistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be \\ninstructed to return for follow-up visits.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nUncomplicated VVC is not usually acquired through sexual \\n\\nintercourse, and data do not support treatment of sex partners. \\nA minority of male sex partners have balanitis, characterized \\nby erythematous areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction \\nwith pruritus or irritation. These men benefit from treatment \\nwith topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\nTopical agents usually cause no systemic side effects, although \\n\\nlocal burning or irritation might occur. Oral azoles occasionally \\ncause nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Therapy with the \\noral azoles has rarely been associated with abnormal elevations \\nof liver enzymes. Clinically important interactions can occur \\nwhen oral azoles are administered with other drugs (1141).\\n\\nComplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nVaginal culture or PCR should be obtained from women \\n\\nwith complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and \\nidentify non–albicans Candida. Candida glabrata does not \\nform pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized \\non microscopy. C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more \\ncommon in vaginal isolates (1144,1145), and non–albicans \\nCandida is intrinsically resistant to azoles; therefore, culture \\nand susceptibility testing should be considered for patients \\nwho remain symptomatic.\\n\\nRecurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nRecurrent VVC, usually defined as three or more episodes \\n\\nof symptomatic VVC in <1 year, affects <5% of women but \\ncarries a substantial economic burden (1146). Recurrent VVC \\ncan be either idiopathic or secondary (related to frequent \\nantibiotic use, diabetes, or other underlying host factors). The \\npathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the \\nmajority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent \\n\\npredisposing or underlying conditions. C. glabrata and other \\nnon–albicans Candida species are observed in 10%–20% \\nof women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic \\ntherapies are not as effective against these non–albicans yeasts \\nas against C. albicans.\\n\\nTreatment\\nMost episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans \\n\\nrespond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. \\nHowever, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer \\nduration of initial therapy (e.g., 7–14 days of topical therapy \\nor a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole \\nevery third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) \\nis recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before \\ninitiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.\\n\\nOral fluconazole (i.e., a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) \\nweekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. \\nIf this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used \\nintermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance \\ntherapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are \\nrarely curative long-term (1147). Because C. albicans azole \\nresistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if \\navailable, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who \\nremain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These \\nwomen should be managed in consultation with a specialist.\\n\\nSevere Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nSevere VVC (i.e., extensive vulvar erythema, edema, \\n\\nexcoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower \\nclinical response rates among patients treated with short courses \\nof topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or \\n150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose \\n72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.\\n\\nNon–albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nBecause approximately 50% of women with a positive culture \\n\\nfor non–albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or \\nhave no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often \\ndifficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other \\ncauses of vaginal symptoms for women with non–albicans \\nyeast (1148). The optimal treatment of non–albicans VVC \\nremains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy \\n(7–14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or \\ntopical) is recommended. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric \\nacid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for \\n3 weeks is indicated. This regimen has clinical and mycologic \\neradication rates of approximately 70% (1149). If symptoms \\nrecur, referral to a specialist is advised.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n94 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nNo data exist to support treating sex partners of patients with \\n\\ncomplicated VVC. Therefore, no recommendation can be made.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nCompromised Host\\nWomen with underlying immunodeficiency, those with \\n\\npoorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising \\nconditions (e.g., HIV), and those receiving immunosuppression \\ntherapy (e.g., corticosteroid treatment) might not respond as \\nwell to short-term therapies. Efforts to correct modifiable \\nconditions should be made, and more prolonged (i.e., \\n7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary.\\n\\nPregnancy\\nVVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical \\n\\nazole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use \\namong pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a \\nsingle 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with \\nspontaneous abortion (1150) and congenital anomalies; \\ntherefore, it should not be used (1151).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nVaginal Candida colonization rates among women with \\n\\nHIV infection are higher than among women without HIV \\nwith similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, \\nand the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of \\nimmunosuppression (1152). Symptomatic VVC is also more \\nfrequent among women with HIV infection and similarly \\ncorrelates with severity of immunodeficiency (1153). In \\naddition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure \\nis associated with isolation of non–albicans Candida species \\nfrom the vagina.\\n\\nTreatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC \\namong women with HIV infection should not differ from \\nthat for women who do not have HIV. Although long-\\nterm prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly \\nhas been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and \\nsymptomatic VVC (1154), this regimen is not recommended \\nfor women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated \\nVVC (98). Although VVC is associated with increased HIV \\nseroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased \\nHIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, \\nthe effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and \\ntransmission remains unknown.\\n\\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease\\nPID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of \\n\\nthe upper female genital tract, including any combination \\nof endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic \\nperitonitis (1155–1157). Sexually transmitted organisms, \\nespecially N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, often are \\nimplicated. Recent studies report that the proportion of \\nPID cases attributable to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis is \\ndecreasing; of women who received a diagnosis of acute PID, \\napproximately 50% have a positive test for either of those \\norganisms (1158–1160). Micro-organisms that comprise the \\nvaginal flora, such as strict and facultative anaerobes (1160) \\nand G. vaginalis, H. influenzae, enteric gram-negative rods, and \\nStreptococcus agalactiae, have been associated with PID (1161). \\nIn addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV), T. vaginalis, M. hominis, \\nand U. urealyticum might be associated with certain PID cases \\n(1072). Data also indicate that M. genitalium might have a role \\nin PID pathogenesis (765,928) and might be associated with \\nmilder symptoms (919,923,928), although one study failed \\nto demonstrate a substantial increase in PID after detection of \\nM. genitalium in the lower genital tract (925).\\n\\nScreening and treating sexually active women for chlamydia \\nand gonorrhea reduces their risk for PID (1162,1163). Although \\nBV is associated with PID, whether PID incidence can be \\nreduced by identifying and treating women with BV is unclear \\n(1161). Whether screening young women for M. genitalium is \\nassociated with a reduction in PID is unknown.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nAcute PID is difficult to diagnose because of the considerable \\n\\nvariation in symptoms and signs associated with this condition. \\nWomen with PID often have subtle or nonspecific symptoms or \\nare asymptomatic. Delay in diagnosis and treatment probably \\ncontributes to inflammatory sequelae in the upper genital tract. \\nLaparoscopy can be used to obtain a more accurate diagnosis \\nof salpingitis and a more complete bacteriologic diagnosis. \\nHowever, this diagnostic tool frequently is not readily available, \\nand its use is not easily justifiable when symptoms are mild or \\nvague. Moreover, laparoscopy will not detect endometritis and \\nmight not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes. \\nConsequently, a PID diagnosis usually is based on imprecise \\nclinical findings (1164–1166).\\n\\nData indicate that a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic PID \\nhas a positive predictive value for salpingitis of 65%–90%, \\ncompared with laparoscopy (1167–1170). The positive \\npredictive value of a clinical diagnosis of acute PID depends on \\nthe epidemiologic characteristics of the population, with higher \\npositive predictive values among sexually active young women \\n(particularly adolescents), women attending STD clinics, and \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 95US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nthose who live in communities with high rates of gonorrhea \\nor chlamydia. Regardless of positive predictive value, no single \\nhistorical, physical, or laboratory finding is both sensitive \\nand specific for the diagnosis of acute PID. Combinations of \\ndiagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity (i.e., detect \\nmore women who have PID) or specificity (i.e., exclude more \\nwomen who do not have PID) do so only at the expense of the \\nother. For example, requiring two or more findings excludes \\nmore women who do not have PID and reduces the number \\nof women with PID who are identified.\\n\\nEpisodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain \\ncases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because \\nthe patient or the health care provider do not recognize the \\nimplications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g., \\nabnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even \\nwomen with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for \\ninfertility (1157). Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and \\nthe potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, \\nhealth care providers should maintain a low threshold for the \\nclinical diagnosis of PID (1158). The recommendations for \\ndiagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to \\nrecognize when PID should be suspected and when additional \\ninformation should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. \\nDiagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal \\npain (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, \\novarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired \\nby initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive \\ntreatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active \\nyoung women and other women at risk for STIs if they are \\nexperiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for \\nthe illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more \\nof the following three minimum clinical criteria are present \\non pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine \\ntenderness, or adnexal tenderness.\\n\\nMore specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial \\nbiopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; \\ntransvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging \\ntechniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or \\nwithout free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler \\nstudies indicating pelvic infection (e.g., tubal hyperemia); \\nand laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic \\nevaluation that includes some of these more extensive \\nprocedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial \\nbiopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who \\ndo not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis \\nis the only sign of PID for certain women.\\n\\nRequiring that all three minimum criteria be present \\nbefore the initiation of empiric treatment can result in \\ninsufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding \\nwhether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also \\n\\nconsider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic \\nevaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis \\nand management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. \\nFor example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract \\ninflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal \\nsecretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition \\nto one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of \\nthe diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria \\ncan be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical \\ncriteria and support a PID diagnosis:\\n\\n• Oral temperature >38.3°C (>101°F)\\n• Abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical \\n\\nfriability\\n• Presence of abundant numbers of WBCs on saline \\n\\nmicroscopy of vaginal fluid\\n• Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\n• Elevated C-reactive protein\\n• Laboratory documentation of cervical infection with \\n\\nN. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis\\nThe majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent \\n\\ncervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a microscopic \\nevaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal fluid (i.e., wet \\nprep). If the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs \\nare observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, a PID diagnosis \\nis unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered. \\nA wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of \\nconcomitant infections (e.g., BV or trichomoniasis).\\n\\nTreatment\\nPID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broad-\\n\\nspectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Multiple parenteral and \\noral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving \\nclinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials \\nwith short-term follow-up (1171–1173). However, only \\na limited number of studies have assessed and compared \\nthese regimens with regard to infection elimination in the \\nendometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence \\nof long-term complications (e.g., tubal infertility and ectopic \\npregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens (1159,1164,1174). \\nThe optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of \\nearly treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. \\nAll regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against \\nN. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical \\nscreening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital \\ntract infection. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the \\nupper genital tract of women who have PID, and data from in \\nvitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides \\nfragilis) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. BV is often \\npresent among women who have PID (22,1160,1161,1175). \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n96 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nAddition of metronidazole to IM or oral PID regimens more \\neffectively eradicates anaerobic organisms from the upper \\ngenital tract (1160). Until treatment regimens that do not \\ncover anaerobic microbes have been demonstrated to prevent \\nlong-term sequelae (e.g., infertility and ectopic pregnancy) \\nas successfully as the regimens that are effective against these \\nmicrobes, using regimens with anaerobic activity should \\nbe considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the \\npresumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of \\nlong-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of \\nrecommended antimicrobials. For women with PID of mild or \\nmoderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear \\nto have similar efficacy. The decision of whether hospitalization \\nis necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether \\nthe woman meets any of the following criteria:\\n\\n• Surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be \\nexcluded\\n\\n• Tubo-ovarian abscess\\n• Pregnancy\\n• Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature \\n\\n>38.5°C (101°F)\\n• Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen\\n• No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy\\nNo evidence is available to indicate that adolescents have \\n\\nimproved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, \\nand the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar \\namong younger and older women. The decision to hospitalize \\nadolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria \\nused for older women.\\n\\nParenteral Treatment\\nRandomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of \\n\\nparenteral regimens (1160,1171,1172,1176). Clinical \\nexperience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral \\ntherapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of \\nclinical improvement.

Oral and IV \\nadministration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide \\nsimilar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed \\nand can be considered instead of IV for women without severe \\nillness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical \\nimprovement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy \\nwith doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole \\n500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of \\nantimicrobial therapy.\\n\\nAlternative Parenteral Regimens\\nOnly limited data are available to support using other \\n\\nparenteral second- or third- generation cephalosporins (e.g., \\nceftizoxime or cefotaxime).

However, when tubo-ovarian \\nabscess is present, clindamycin (450 mg orally 4 times/day) or \\nmetronidazole (500 mg orally 2 times/day) should be used to \\ncomplete 14 days of therapy with oral doxycycline to provide \\nmore effective anaerobic coverage.\\n\\nAlternative Parenteral Regimens\\n\\nAmpicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours\\nplus\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours\\nor\\n\\nClindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours\\nplus\\n\\nGentamicin loading dose IV or IM (2 mg/kg body weight), followed by a \\nmaintenance dose (1.5 mg/kg body weight) every 8 hours; single daily \\ndosing (3–5 mg/kg body weight) can be substituted\\n\\nIntramuscular or Oral Treatment\\nIM or oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-\\n\\nto-moderate acute PID because the clinical outcomes among \\nwomen treated with these regimens are similar to those treated \\nwith IV therapy (1158).

Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, has \\nbetter anaerobic coverage than ceftriaxone, and, in combination \\nwith probenecid and doxycycline, has been effective in short-\\nterm clinical response among women with PID. Ceftriaxone \\nhas better coverage against N. gonorrhoeae. The addition of \\nmetronidazole to these regimens provides extended coverage \\nagainst anaerobic organisms and will also effectively treat BV, \\nwhich is frequently associated with PID.\\n\\nAlternative Intramuscular or Oral Regimens\\nNo data have been published regarding use of oral \\n\\ncephalosporins for treating PID. As a result of the emergence \\nof quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, regimens that include \\na quinolone agent are not recommended for PID treatment. \\nHowever, if the patient has cephalosporin allergy, the \\ncommunity prevalence and individual risk for gonorrhea \\nare low, and follow-up is likely, alternative therapy can be \\nconsidered. Use of either levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily \\nor moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily with metronidazole \\n500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days (1179–1181) or \\nazithromycin 500 mg IV daily for 1–2 doses, followed by \\n250 mg orally daily in combination with metronidazole \\n500 mg 2 times/day for 12–14 days (1178), can be considered. \\nMoxifloxacin is the preferred quinolone antimicrobial for \\nM. genitalium infections; however, the importance of providing \\ncoverage for M. genitalium is unknown. Diagnostic tests for \\ngonorrhea should be obtained before starting therapy, and \\npersons should be managed as follows:\\n\\n• If a culture for gonorrhea is positive, treatment should be \\nbased on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\\n\\n• If the isolate is determined to be quinolone-resistant \\nN. gonorrhoeae or if antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be \\nassessed (e.g., if only NAAT testing is available), consultation \\nwith an infectious disease specialist is recommended.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nTo minimize disease transmission, women should be \\n\\ninstructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is \\ncomplete, symptoms have resolved, and sex partners have been \\ntreated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). \\nAll women who receive a diagnosis of PID should be tested \\nfor gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and syphilis. The value of \\ntesting women with PID for M. genitalium is unknown (see \\nMycoplasma genitalium). All contraceptive methods can be \\ncontinued during treatment. \\n\\nFollow-Up\\nWomen should demonstrate clinical improvement (e.g., \\n\\ndefervescence; reduction in direct or rebound abdominal \\ntenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical \\nmotion tenderness) <3 days after therapy initiation. If no \\nclinical improvement has occurred <72 hours after outpatient \\nIM or oral therapy, then hospitalization, assessment of the \\nantimicrobial regimen, and additional diagnostics, including \\nconsideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative \\ndiagnoses, are recommended. All women who have received a \\ndiagnosis of chlamydial or gonococcal PID should be retested \\n3 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex \\npartners have been treated (753). If retesting at 3 months is \\nnot possible, these women should be retested whenever they \\nnext seek medical care <12 months after treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nPersons who have had sexual contact with a partner with \\n\\nPID during the 60 days preceding symptom onset should be \\nevaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia \\nand gonorrhea, regardless of the PID etiology or pathogens \\nisolated. If the last sexual intercourse was >60 days before \\nsymptom onset or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should \\nbe treated. Sex partners of persons who have PID caused by \\nC. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic. \\nArrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. If \\nlinkage is delayed or unlikely, EPT is an alternative approach \\nto treating sex partners who have chlamydial or gonococcal \\ninfection (125,126) (see Partner Services). Partners should \\nbe instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n98 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nand their sex partners have been treated (i.e., until therapy is \\ncompleted and symptoms have resolved, if originally present).\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\n\\nThe risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is highest with first-\\ngeneration cephalosporins but is negligible between the \\nmajority of second-generation (e.g., cefoxitin) and all third-\\ngeneration (e.g., ceftriaxone) cephalosporins (619,631,653,656) \\n(see Management of Persons Who Have a History of \\nPenicillin Allergy).\\n\\nPregnancy\\nPregnant women suspected of having PID are at high risk \\n\\nfor maternal morbidity and preterm delivery. These women \\nshould be hospitalized and treated with IV antimicrobials in \\nconsultation with an infectious disease specialist.\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nDifferences in PID clinical manifestations among women \\n\\nwith HIV infection and those without have not been well \\ndelineated (1182). In early observational studies, women \\nwith HIV infection and PID were more likely to require \\nsurgical intervention. More comprehensive observational \\nand controlled studies have demonstrated that women with \\nHIV infection and PID coinfection have similar symptoms, \\ncompared with women without HIV (1183–1185), except \\nthey are more likely to have a tubo-ovarian abscess. Women \\nwith HIV responded equally well to recommended parenteral \\nand IM or oral antibiotic regimens as women without HIV. \\nThe microbiologic findings for women with HIV and women \\nwithout HIV were similar, except women with HIV had \\nhigher rates of concomitant M. hominis and streptococcal \\ninfections. These data are insufficient for determining whether \\nwomen with HIV infection and PID coinfection require \\nmore aggressive management (e.g., hospitalization or IV \\nantimicrobial regimens).\\n\\nIntrauterine Devices\\nIUDs are one of the most effective contraceptive methods. \\n\\nCopper-containing and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are \\navailable in the United States. The risk for PID associated with \\nIUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion \\n(1186–1188). If an IUD user receives a diagnosis of PID, \\nthe IUD does not need to be removed (59,1189). However, \\nthe woman should receive treatment according to these \\nrecommendations and should have close clinical follow-up. \\nIf no clinical improvement occurs within 48–72 hours of \\ninitiating treatment, providers should consider removing \\n\\nthe IUD. A systematic review of evidence demonstrated that \\ntreatment outcomes did not differ between women with PID \\nwho retained the IUD and those who had the IUD removed \\n(1190). These studies primarily included women using copper-\\ncontaining or other nonhormonal IUDs. No studies are \\navailable regarding treatment outcomes among women using \\nlevonorgestrel-releasing IUDs.\\n\\nEpididymitis\\nAcute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, \\n\\nswelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting \\n<6 weeks (1191). Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a \\ncondition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index \\nof suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should \\nbe maintained among men who have a sudden onset of \\nsymptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition \\nis a surgical emergency.\\n\\nAcute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g., C. trachomatis, \\nN. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e., \\nEscherichia coli) (1192). Acute epididymitis caused by an \\nSTI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently \\nasymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually \\ntransmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men \\nwho are the insertive partner during anal sex. Nonsexually \\ntransmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary \\npathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to \\nbladder outlet obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia) \\n(1193). Among older men, nonsexually transmitted \\nacute epididymitis is also associated with prostate biopsy, \\nurinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, \\nor immunosuppression. Uncommon infectious causes of \\nnonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis (e.g., Fournier’s \\ngangrene) should be managed in consultation with a urologist.\\n\\nChronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥6-week history \\nof symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or \\nepididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently \\nobserved with conditions associated with a granulomatous \\nreaction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is the most common \\ngranulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be \\nsuspected, especially among men with a known history of or recent \\nexposure to TB. The differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious \\nepididymitis, sometimes termed orchialgia or epididymalgia, is \\nbroad (e.g., trauma, cancer, autoimmune conditions, or idiopathic \\nconditions). Men with this diagnosis should be referred to a \\nurologist for clinical management (1191,1192).\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 99US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nMen who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral \\n\\ntesticular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling \\nof the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling \\nusually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to \\nthe rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord \\nis usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) \\ntorsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; \\nhowever, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and \\nmen without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men \\nwith severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose \\ntest results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary \\ntract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is \\nquestionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation \\nfor testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might \\nbe compromised.\\n\\nBilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes \\nof testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the \\nmost accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is \\nnot routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily \\nfor ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, \\nunilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial \\nspermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal \\nultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion \\nand epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound \\nshould be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although \\nultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and \\nswelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal \\ndiagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation \\nconsistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does \\nnot rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical \\nmanagement. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion \\nof the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain \\nwho cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical \\nexamination, and objective laboratory findings.\\n\\nAll suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated \\nfor objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following \\nPOC tests:\\n\\n• Gram, MB, or GV stain of urethral secretions demonstrating \\n≥2 WBCs per oil immersion field (737) (see Urethritis). \\nThese stains are preferred POC diagnostic tests for \\nevaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and \\nspecific for documenting both urethral inflammation and \\npresence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal \\ninfection is established by documenting the presence of \\nWBC-containing intracellular gram-negative or purple \\ndiplococci on urethral Gram, MB, or GV stain, respectively.\\n\\n• Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine.\\n• Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-\\n\\nvoid urine demonstrating ≥10 WBCs/HPF.\\nAll suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested \\n\\nfor C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAAT. Urine is \\nthe preferred specimen for NAAT for men (553). Urine \\ncultures for chlamydial and gonococcal epididymitis are \\ninsensitive and are not recommended. Urine bacterial \\ncultures should also be performed for all men to evaluate for \\nthe presence of genitourinary organisms and to determine \\nantibiotic susceptibility.\\n\\nTreatment\\nTo prevent complications and transmission of STIs, \\n\\npresumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated \\nat the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are \\navailable. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for \\nchlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. \\nTreatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic \\ninfection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, \\n3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to \\nothers, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal \\nepididymitis complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). \\nAlthough the majority of men with acute epididymitis can \\nbe treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and \\nhospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever \\nindicates other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, \\nabscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to \\ncomply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, \\nfever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe \\ndisease requiring hospitalization (1193).\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Epididymitis\\n\\nFor acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea: \\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\n\\nplus\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days\\n\\nFor acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, \\nor enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex): \\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\n\\nplus\\nLevofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days\\n\\nFor acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only: \\nLevofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days\\n\\n* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.\\n\\nLevofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the \\ninfection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and \\ngonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain. This \\nincludes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, \\nand other urinary tract instrumentation procedures. Treatment \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n100 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nshould be guided by bacterial cultures and antimicrobial \\nsusceptibilities. As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal \\nelevation, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are \\nrecommended until fever and local inflammation have \\nsubsided. Complete resolution of discomfort might not occur \\nfor a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nMen who have acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to \\n\\nbe caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised \\nto abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners \\nhave been treated and symptoms have resolved. All men with \\nacute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nMen should be instructed to return to their health care \\n\\nproviders if their symptoms do not improve <72 hours after \\ntreatment. Signs and symptoms of epididymitis that do not \\nsubside in <3 days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and \\ntherapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that \\npersist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be \\nevaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, \\ninfarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nMen who have acute sexually transmitted epididymitis \\n\\nconfirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or \\nC. trachomatis should be instructed to refer all sex partners \\nduring the previous 60 days before symptom onset for \\nevaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment (see Chlamydial \\nInfections; Gonococcal Infections). If the last sexual intercourse \\nwas >60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the \\nmost recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated. \\nArrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. EPT \\nis an effective strategy for treating sex partners of men who \\nhave or are suspected of having chlamydia or gonorrhea for \\nwhom linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed (125,126) \\n(see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain \\nfrom sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are \\ntreated and symptoms have resolved.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\nThe risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is negligible between all \\n\\nthird-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) (658,681) \\n(see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin \\n\\nAllergy). Alternative regimens have not been studied; therefore, \\nclinicians should consult an infectious disease specialist if such \\nregimens are required.\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nMen with HIV infection who have uncomplicated acute \\n\\nepididymitis should receive the same treatment regimen as \\nthose who do not have HIV. Other etiologic agents have \\nbeen implicated in acute epididymitis among men with HIV, \\nincluding CMV, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, U. urealyticum, \\nCorynebacterium species, Mycoplasma species, and Mima \\npolymorpha (1192).\\n\\nHuman Papillomavirus Infections\\nApproximately 150 types of HPV have been identified, at \\n\\nleast 40 of which infect the genital area (1194). The majority \\nof HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or \\nunrecognized. Sexually active persons are usually exposed to \\nHPV during their lifetime (838,1195,1196). Oncogenic, \\nhigh-risk HPV infection (e.g., HPV types 16 and 18) causes the \\nmajority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal \\ncancers and precancers (1197), whereas other HPV infection \\n(e.g., HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent \\nrespiratory papillomatosis. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection \\nis the strongest risk factor for development of HPV-attributable \\nprecancers and cancers. A substantial proportion of cancers and \\nanogenital warts are attributable to HPV in the United States. \\nAn estimated 34,800 new HPV-attributable cancers occurred \\nevery year during 2012–2016 (1198). Before HPV vaccines were \\nintroduced, approximately 355,000 new cases of anogenital warts \\noccurred every year (1199).\\n\\nPrevention\\nHPV Vaccines\\n\\nThree HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States: \\nCeravrix, a 2-valent vaccine (2vHPV) that targets HPV types \\n16 and 18; Gardasil, a 4-valent vaccine (4vHPV) that targets \\nHPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18; and Gardasil 9, a 9-valent \\nvaccine (9vHPV) that targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, \\n33, 45, 52, and 58. Types 16 and 18 account for 66% of all \\ncervical cancers, whereas the five additional types targeted by \\nthe 9-valent vaccine account for 15%. Types 6 and 11 cause \\n>90% of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine is available in \\nthe United States.\\n\\nACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination (https://www.\\ncdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html) include \\nthe following:\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 101US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n• Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or \\n12 years.\\n\\n• Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.\\n• Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not \\n\\nvaccinated previously.\\n• Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged >26 years. \\n\\nInstead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient \\nand a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended \\nfor certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously.\\n\\n• A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month \\nintervals) is recommended for persons who initiate \\nvaccination before their 15th birthday.\\n\\n• A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month \\nintervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of \\nage of initiation.\\n\\nHPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant \\nwomen. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of \\nhistory of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or \\nanogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine \\nshould continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical \\nCancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and \\nadolescents aged <19 years through the Vaccines for Children \\n(VFC) program (additional information is available at https://\\nwww.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html or by calling \\nCDC INFO 800-232-4636). For uninsured persons aged \\n<19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the \\nvaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety \\nevaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. \\nWith >120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the \\nUnited States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are \\nsafe (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety). Impact-monitoring \\nstudies in the United States have demonstrated reductions \\nof genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within \\nthe quadrivalent vaccine (1200–1203). Settings that provide \\nSTI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible \\nclients within the routine and catch-up age groups through \\nage 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine \\nseries, or link these persons to another facility equipped to \\nprovide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, \\nadolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about \\nHPV and the vaccine (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/\\nteens/for-hcp/hpv-resources.html). HPV vaccination has not \\nbeen associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk \\nbehaviors (1204,1205).\\n\\nAbstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method \\nfor preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease \\ntheir chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct \\ncondom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although \\nthese interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they \\ncan decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nHPV tests are available for detecting oncogenic types of HPV \\n\\ninfection and are used in the context of cervical cancer screening \\nand management or follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology or \\nhistology (see Cervical Cancer). These tests should not be used \\nfor male partners of women with HPV or women aged <25 years, \\nfor diagnosis of genital warts, or as a general STI test.\\n\\nApplication of 3%–5% acetic acid, which might cause \\naffected areas to turn white, has been used by certain providers \\nto detect genital mucosa infected with HPV. The routine use \\nof this procedure to detect mucosal changes attributed to \\nHPV infection is not recommended because the results do \\nnot influence clinical management.\\n\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is directed to the macroscopic (e.g., genital warts) \\n\\nor pathologic precancerous lesions caused by HPV. Subclinical \\ngenital HPV infection typically clears spontaneously; therefore, \\nspecific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate HPV \\ninfection. Precancerous lesions are detected through cervical \\ncancer screening; HPV-related precancer should be managed \\non the basis of existing guidance (see Cervical Cancer).\\n\\nCounseling\\n\\nKey Messages for Persons with Human \\nPapillomavirus Infection\\n\\nWhen counseling persons with anogenital HPV infection, \\nthe provider should discuss the following:\\n\\n• Anogenital HPV infection is common. It usually infects \\nthe anogenital area but can infect other areas, including \\nthe mouth and throat. The majority of sexually active \\npersons get HPV at some time during their lifetime, \\nalthough most never know it.\\n\\n• Partners tend to share HPV, and it is not possible to \\ndetermine which partner transmitted the original \\ninfection. Having HPV does not mean that a person or \\nhis or her partner is having sex outside the relationship.\\n\\n• Persons who acquire HPV usually clear the infection \\nspontaneously, meaning that HPV becomes undetectable \\nwith no associated health problems.\\n\\n• If HPV infection persists, genital warts, precancers, and \\ncancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, or \\nneck might develop.\\n\\n• Discussion of tobacco use, and provision of cessation \\ncounseling, is important because of its contribution to the \\nprogression of precancer and cancer.\\n\\n• The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different \\nfrom the types that can cause cancer.\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/teens/for-hcp/hpv-resources.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/teens/for-hcp/hpv-resources.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n102 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n• Many types of HPV are sexually transmitted through \\nanogenital contact, mainly during vaginal and anal sex. HPV \\nalso might be transmitted during oral sex and genital-to-genital \\ncontact without penetration. In rare cases, a pregnant woman \\ncan transmit HPV to an infant during delivery.\\n\\n• Treatments are available for the conditions caused by HPV \\nbut not for the virus itself.\\n\\n• Having HPV does not make it harder for a woman to get \\npregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. However, certain \\nprecancers or cancers that HPV can cause, and the surgical \\nprocedures needed to treat them, can affect a woman’s \\nability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term.\\n\\n• No HPV test can determine which HPV infection will \\nbecome undetectable and which will persist or progress to \\ndisease. However, in certain circumstances, HPV tests can \\ndetermine whether a woman is at increased risk for cervical \\ncancer. These tests are not for detecting other HPV-related \\nproblems, nor are they useful for women aged<25 years \\nor men of any age.\\n\\nPrevention\\n• Three HPV vaccines can prevent diseases and cancers \\n\\ncaused by HPV. The 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV vaccines \\nprotect against the majority of cervical cancer cases, \\nalthough the 4vHPV and 9vHPV vaccines also protect \\nagainst the majority of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine \\nis available in the United States. HPV vaccines are safe \\nand effective and are recommended routinely for \\nadolescents aged 11–12 years. Catch-up vaccination is also \\nrecommended for older adolescents and young adults \\nthrough age 26 years (https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/\\nindex.html). Shared clinical decision-making is \\nrecommended regarding HPV vaccination for certain \\nadults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated \\nper guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/\\nwr/pdfs/mm6832a3-H.pdf ).\\n\\n• Condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the \\nchances of acquiring and transmitting HPV and \\ndeveloping HPV-related diseases (e.g., genital warts or \\ncervical cancer). However, because HPV can infect areas \\nnot covered by a condom, condoms might not fully protect \\nagainst HPV.\\n\\n• Limiting the number of sex partners can reduce the risk \\nfor HPV. However, even persons with only one lifetime \\nsex partner can get HPV.\\n\\n• Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method \\nfor preventing genital HPV infection.\\n\\nAnogenital Warts\\nAnogenital warts are a common disease, and 90% are caused \\n\\nby nononcogenic HPV types 6 or 11. These types can be \\ncommonly identified before or at the same time anogenital \\nwarts are detected (1206). HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 \\nalso are occasionally identified in anogenital warts (usually \\nas infections with HPV 6 or 11) and can be associated with \\nfoci of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), \\nparticularly among persons who have HIV infection. In \\naddition to anogenital warts, HPV types 6 and 11 have been \\nassociated with conjunctival, nasal, oral, and laryngeal warts.\\n\\nAnogenital warts are usually asymptomatic; however, \\ndepending on the size and anatomic location, they can \\nbe painful or pruritic. They are usually flat, papular, or \\npedunculated growths on the genital mucosa. Anogenital warts \\noccur commonly at certain anatomic sites, including around \\nthe vaginal introitus, under the foreskin of the uncircumcised \\npenis, and on the shaft of the circumcised penis. Warts can \\nalso occur at multiple sites in the anogenital epithelium or \\nwithin the anogenital tract (e.g., cervix, vagina, urethra, \\nperineum, perianal skin, anus, or scrotum). Intra-anal warts \\nare observed predominantly in persons who have had receptive \\nanal intercourse; however, they also can occur among men and \\nwomen who have not had a history of anal sexual contact.\\n\\nPrevention\\nAnogenital warts have decreased among adolescents, \\n\\nyoung women, and heterosexual men with use of HPV \\nvaccination in multiple countries, including the United States \\n(1203,1207–1216).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nDiagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual \\n\\ninspection but can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated \\nif lesions are atypical (e.g., pigmented, indurated, affixed to \\nunderlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might \\nalso be indicated in the following circumstances, particularly \\nif the patient is immunocompromised (including those with \\nHIV infection): the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not \\nrespond to standard therapy, or the disease worsens during \\ntherapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart \\ndiagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not \\nguide genital wart management. Some anogenital lesions can \\nresemble anogenital warts (condyloma accuminata), but do \\nnot respond to anogenital wart treatment. Condyloma lata, \\na manifestation of secondary syphilis, can be diagnosed by \\nserologic tests or through direct detection from serous fluid \\nfrom the lesions (see Syphilis, Diagnostic Considerations).\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/index.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/index.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6832a3-H.pdf\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6832a3-H.pdf\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 103US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nTreatment\\nThe aim of treatment is removal of the warts and amelioration \\n\\nof symptoms, if present. The appearance of warts also can result \\nin considerable psychosocial distress, and removal can relieve \\ncosmetic concerns. For most patients, treatment results in \\nresolution of the warts. If left untreated, anogenital warts can \\nresolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or \\nnumber. Because warts might spontaneously resolve in <1 year, \\nan acceptable alternative for certain persons is to forego treatment \\nand wait for spontaneous resolution. Available therapies for \\nanogenital warts might reduce, but probably do not eradicate, \\nHPV infectivity. Whether reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting \\nfrom treatment reduces future transmission remains unknown.\\n\\nTreatment of anogenital warts should be guided by wart size, \\nnumber, and anatomic site; patient preference; cost of treatment; \\nconvenience; adverse effects; and provider experience. No \\ndefinitive evidence indicates that any one recommended treatment \\nis superior to another, and no single treatment is ideal for all \\npatients or all warts. Shared clinical decision-making between \\na patient and a provider regarding treatment algorithms has \\nbeen associated with improved clinical outcomes and should be \\nencouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, \\nclinicians sometimes use combination therapy (e.g., provider-\\nadministered cryotherapy with patient-applied topical therapy \\nbetween visits to the provider). However, limited data exist \\nregarding the efficacy or risk for complications associated with \\ncombination therapy. Treatment regimens are classified as either \\npatient-applied or provider-administered modalities. Patient-\\napplied modalities are preferred by certain persons because they \\ncan be administered in the privacy of their home. To ensure \\nthat patient-applied modalities are effective, instructions should \\nbe provided to patients while in the clinic, and all anogenital \\nwarts should be accessible and identified during the clinic visit. \\nFollow-up visits after weeks of therapy enable providers to answer \\nany questions about use of the medication, address any side effects \\nexperienced, and facilitate assessment of the response to treatment.\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for External Anogenital Warts (i.e., \\nPenis, Groin, Scrotum, Vulva, Perineum, External Anus, or \\nPerianus)*\\n\\nPatient-applied: Imiquimod 3.75% or 5% cream†\\nor\\n\\nPodofilox 0.5% solution or gel\\nor\\n\\nSinecatechins 15% ointment†\\n\\nProvider-administered: Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe\\nor\\n\\nSurgical removal by tangential scissor excision, tangential shave \\nexcision, curettage, laser, or electrosurgery\\n\\nor\\nTrichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA)  \\n80%–90% solution\\n\\n* Persons with external anal or perianal warts might also have intra-anal \\nwarts. Thus, persons with external anal warts might benefit from an \\ninspection of the anal canal by digital examination, standard anoscopy, \\nor high-resolution anoscopy.\\n\\n† Might weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms.\\n\\nImiquimod is a patient-applied, topically active immune \\nenhancer that stimulates production of interferon and other \\ncytokines. Imiquimod 5% cream should be applied once \\nat bedtime, 3 times/week for <16 weeks (1217). Similarly, \\nimiquimod 3.75% cream should be applied once at bedtime \\nevery night for <8 weeks (1218). With either formulation, the \\ntreatment area should be washed with soap and water 6–10 hours \\nafter the application. Local inflammatory reactions, including \\nredness, irritation, induration, ulceration or erosion, and vesicles \\nmight occur with using imiquimod, and hypopigmentation has \\nalso been described (1219). Limited case reports demonstrate \\nan association between treatment with imiquimod cream and \\nworsened inflammatory or autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., \\npsoriasis, vitiligo, or lichenoid dermatoses) (1220–1222). Data \\nfrom studies of human participants are limited regarding use of \\nimiquimod during pregnancy; however, animal data indicate \\nthat this therapy poses low risk (431).\\n\\nPodofilox (podophyllotoxin) is a patient-applied antimitotic \\ndrug that causes wart necrosis. Podofilox solution (using a \\ncotton swab) or podofilox gel (using a finger) should be applied \\nto anogenital warts 2 times/day for 3 days, followed by 4 days \\nof no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary, for up \\nto four cycles. The total wart area treated should not exceed \\n10 cm2, and the total volume of podofilox should be limited to \\n0.5 mL/day. If possible, the health care provider should apply the \\ninitial treatment to demonstrate proper application technique \\nand identify which warts should be treated. Mild to moderate \\npain or local irritation might develop after treatment. After each \\ntreatment, the gel or solution should be allowed to dry. Patients \\nshould wash their hands before and after each application. \\nPodofilox is contraindicated during pregnancy (431).\\n\\nSinecatechins is a patient-applied, green-tea extract with an \\nactive product (catechins). Sinecatechins 15% ointment should \\nbe applied 3 times/day (0.5-cm strand of ointment to each wart) \\nby using a finger to ensure coverage with a thin layer of ointment \\nuntil complete clearance of warts is achieved. This product should \\nnot be continued for >16 weeks (1223–1225). The medication \\nshould not be washed off after use. Genital, anal, and oral sexual \\ncontact should be avoided while the ointment is on the skin. The \\nmost common side effects of sinecatechins are erythema, pruritus \\nor burning, pain, ulceration, edema, induration, and vesicular \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n104 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nrash. This medication is not recommended for persons with HIV \\ninfection, other immunocompromised conditions, or genital herpes \\nbecause the safety and efficacy of therapy has not been evaluated. \\nThe safety of sinecatechins during pregnancy is unknown.\\n\\nCryotherapy is a provider-administered therapy that destroys \\nwarts by thermal-induced cytolysis. Health care providers \\nshould be trained on the correct use of this therapy because \\novertreatment or undertreatment can result in complications \\nor low efficacy. Pain during and after application of the liquid \\nnitrogen, followed by necrosis and sometimes blistering, is \\ncommon. Local anesthesia (topical or injected) might facilitate \\ntherapy if warts are present in many areas or if the area of warts \\nis large. Surgical therapy has the advantage of eliminating the \\nmajority of warts at a single visit, although recurrence can \\noccur. Surgical removal requires substantial clinical training, \\nadditional equipment, and sometimes a longer office visit. After \\nlocal anesthesia is applied, anogenital warts can be physically \\ndestroyed by electrocautery, in which case no additional \\nhemostasis is required. Care should be taken to control the \\ndepth of electrocautery to prevent scarring. Alternatively, the \\nwarts can be removed either by tangential excision with a pair of \\nfine scissors or a scalpel, by CO2 laser, or by curettage. Because \\nmost warts are exophytic, this procedure can be accomplished \\nwith a resulting wound that only extends into the upper dermis. \\nHemostasis can be achieved with an electrocautery unit or, in \\ncases of minor bleeding, a chemical styptic (e.g., an aluminum \\nchloride solution). Suturing is neither required nor indicated \\nin the majority of cases. For patients with large or extensive \\nwarts, surgical therapy, including CO2 laser, might be most \\nbeneficial; such therapy might also be useful for intraurethral \\nwarts, particularly for those persons whose warts have not \\nresponded to other treatments. Treatment of anogenital and \\noral warts should be performed in a ventilated room by using \\nstandard precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/\\nguidelines/isolation/index.html/Isolation2007.pdf#page) and \\nlocal exhaust ventilation (e.g., a smoke evacuator) (1226).\\n\\nTrichloroacetic acid (TCA) and bichloroacetic acid (BCA) \\nare provider-administered caustic agents that destroy warts by \\nchemical coagulation of proteins. Although these preparations \\nare widely used, they have not been investigated thoroughly. \\nTCA solution has a low viscosity, comparable with that of \\nwater, and can spread rapidly and damage adjacent tissues if \\napplied excessively. A small amount should be applied only \\nto the warts and allowed to dry (i.e., develop white frost on \\ntissue) before the patient sits or stands. If pain is intense or an \\nexcess amount of acid is applied, the area can be covered with \\nsodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda), washed with liquid \\nsoap preparations, or be powdered with talc to neutralize the \\n\\nacid or remove unreacted acid. TCA or BCA treatment can be \\nrepeated weekly if necessary.\\n\\nAlternative Regimens for External Genital Warts\\nFewer data are available regarding the efficacy of alternative \\n\\nregimens for treating anogenital warts, which include \\npodophyllin resin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic \\ntherapy, and topical cidofovir. Shared clinical decision-\\nmaking between the patient and provider regarding benefits \\nand risks of these regimens should be provided. In addition, \\nalternative regimens might be associated with more side \\neffects. Podophyllin resin is no longer a recommended regimen \\nbecause of the number of safer regimens available, and severe \\nsystemic toxicity has been reported when podophyllin resin \\nwas applied to large areas of friable tissue and was not washed \\noff within 4 hours (1227–1229). Podophyllin resin 10%–25% \\nin a compound tincture of benzoin might be considered for \\nprovider-administered treatment under conditions of strict \\nadherence to recommendations. Podophyllin should be applied \\nto each wart and then allowed to air dry before the treated area \\ncomes into contact with clothing. Overapplication or failure \\nto air dry can result in local irritation caused by spread of the \\ncompound to adjacent areas and possible systemic toxicity. The \\ntreatment can be repeated weekly, if necessary. To avoid the \\npossibility of complications associated with systemic absorption \\nand toxicity, application should be limited to <0.5 mL of \\npodophyllin or an area of <10 cm2 of warts per session; the \\narea to which treatment is administered should not contain \\nany open lesions, wounds, or friable tissue; and the preparation \\nshould be thoroughly washed off 1–4 hours after application. \\nPodophyllin resin preparations differ in the concentration of \\nactive components and contaminants. Shelf life and stability \\nof podophyllin preparations are unknown. The safety of \\npodophyllin during pregnancy has not been established.\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Urethral Meatus Warts\\n\\nCryotherapy with liquid nitrogen\\nor\\n\\nSurgical removal\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Vaginal Warts\\n\\nCryotherapy with liquid nitrogen\\n\\nThe use of a cryoprobe in the vagina is not recommended because of \\nthe risk for vaginal perforation and fistula formation.\\n\\nor\\nSurgical removal\\n\\nor\\nTrichloracetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) 80%–90% \\nsolution\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Cervical Warts\\n\\nCryotherapy with liquid nitrogen\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html/Isolation2007.pdf#page\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html/Isolation2007.pdf#page\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 105US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nor\\nSurgical removal\\n\\nor\\nTrichloracetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) 80%–90% \\nsolution\\n\\nManagement of cervical warts should include consultation with a specialist.\\nFor women who have exophytic cervical warts, a biopsy evaluation to \\nexclude HSIL should be performed before treatment is initiated.\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Intra-Anal Warts\\n\\nCryotherapy with liquid nitrogen\\nor\\n\\nSurgical removal\\nor\\n\\nTrichloracetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) 80%–90% \\nsolution\\n\\nManagement of intra-anal warts should include consultation with a \\ncolorectal specialist.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nAnogenital warts typically respond within 3 months of \\n\\ntherapy. Factors that might affect response to therapy include \\nimmunosuppression and treatment compliance. Warts \\nlocated on moist surfaces or in intertriginous areas respond \\nbest to topical treatment. A new treatment modality should \\nbe selected when no substantial improvement is observed \\nafter a complete course of treatment or in the event of severe \\nside effects; treatment response and therapy-associated side \\neffects should be evaluated throughout the therapy course. \\nComplications occur rarely when treatment is administered \\ncorrectly. Persistent hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation \\ncan occur with ablative modalities (e.g., cryotherapy and \\nelectrocautery) and have been described with immune \\nmodulating therapies (e.g., imiquimod cream). Depressed or \\nhypertrophic scars are uncommon but can occur, especially \\nif patients have insufficient time to heal between treatments. \\nRarely, treatment can result in chronic pain syndromes (e.g., \\nvulvodynia and hyperesthesia of the treatment site) or, in the \\ncase of anal warts, painful defecation or fistulas.\\n\\nCounseling\\nWhen counseling persons with anogenital warts, the provider \\n\\nshould discuss the following:\\n• If left untreated, genital warts might resolve, stay the same, \\n\\nor increase in size or number. The types of HPV that cause \\ngenital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.\\n\\n• Women with genital warts do not need Pap tests more \\noften than other women.\\n\\n• Time of HPV acquisition cannot be definitively \\ndetermined. Genital warts can develop months or years \\nafter acquiring HPV.\\n\\n• HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on to \\nanother person, even without visible signs of warts. Sex \\npartners tend to share HPV, even though signs of HPV \\n(e.g., warts) might occur in only one or neither partner.\\n\\n• Although genital warts are common and benign, certain \\npersons might experience considerable psychosocial impact \\nafter receiving this diagnosis.\\n\\n• Although genital warts can be treated, such treatment does \\nnot cure the virus itself. For this reason, genital warts often \\nrecur after treatment, especially during the first 3 months.\\n\\n• Because genital warts can be sexually transmitted, persons \\nwith genital warts benefit from testing for other STIs. \\nHPV might remain present and can still be transmitted \\nto partners even after the warts are gone.\\n\\n• Condoms might lower the chances of transmitting genital \\nwarts if used consistently and correctly; however, HPV \\ncan infect areas that are not covered by a condom and \\nmight not fully protect against HPV.\\n\\n• A vaccine is available for males and females to prevent \\ngenital warts (Gardasil 9) but it will not treat existing HPV \\nor genital warts. This vaccine can prevent the majority of \\ncases of genital warts among persons who have not yet \\nbeen exposed to wart-causing types of HPV.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nPersons should inform current partners about having genital \\n\\nwarts because the types of HPV that cause warts can be passed \\non to partners. Partners should be counseled that they might \\nalready have HPV despite no visible signs of warts; therefore, \\nHPV testing of sex partners of persons with genital warts is \\nnot recommended. Partners might benefit from a physical \\nexamination to detect genital warts and tests for other STIs. No \\nrecommendations can be made regarding informing future sex \\npartners about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration \\nof viral persistence after warts have resolved is unknown.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nPodofilox, podophyllin, and sinecatechins should not be \\n\\nused during pregnancy. Imiquimod appears to pose low risk \\nbut should be avoided until more data are available. Anogenital \\nwarts can proliferate and become friable during pregnancy. \\nAlthough removal of warts during pregnancy can be considered, \\nresolution might be incomplete or poor until pregnancy is \\ncomplete. Rarely, HPV types 6 and 11 can cause respiratory \\npapillomatosis among infants and children, although the route \\nof transmission (i.e., transplacental, perinatal, or postnatal) is \\nnot completely understood. Whether cesarean delivery prevents \\nrespiratory papillomatosis among infants and children also \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n106 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nis unclear (1230); therefore, cesarean delivery should not be \\nperformed solely to prevent transmission of HPV infection to \\nthe newborn. Cesarean delivery is indicated for women with \\nanogenital warts if the pelvic outlet is obstructed or if vaginal \\ndelivery would result in excessive bleeding. Pregnant women \\nwith anogenital warts should be counseled about the low risk \\nfor warts on the larynx of their infants or children (recurrent \\nrespiratory papillomatosis).\\n\\nHIV and Other Causes of Immunosuppression\\nPersons with HIV infection or who are otherwise \\n\\nimmunosuppressed are more likely to develop anogenital \\nwarts than those who do not have HIV (1231). Moreover, \\nsuch persons can have larger or more numerous lesions, \\nmight not respond to therapy as well as those who are \\nimmunocompetent, and might have more frequent recurrences \\nafter treatment (1231,1232–1234). Despite these factors, data \\ndo not support altered approaches to treatment for persons \\nwith HIV infection. Squamous cell carcinomas arising in or \\nresembling anogenital warts might occur more frequently \\namong immunosuppressed persons, therefore requiring biopsy \\nfor confirmation of diagnosis for suspicious cases (1235–1237).\\n\\nHigh-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions\\nBiopsy of an atypical wart might reveal HSIL or cancer of \\n\\nthe anogenital tract. In this instance, referral to a specialist for \\ntreatment is recommended.\\n\\nCancers and Precancers Associated with Human \\nPapillomavirus\\n\\nPersistent infection with high-risk (oncogenic) types of HPV \\nhas a causal role in approximately all cervical cancers and in \\ncertain vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers \\n(1238). However, cervical cancer is the only HPV-associated \\ncancer for which routine screening is recommended.\\n\\nCervical Cancer\\n\\nScreening Recommendations\\nRecommendations for cervical cancer screening in the \\n\\nUnited States are based on systematic evidence reviews \\nby major medical and advocacy organizations, including \\nUSPSTF (174), ACS (177), and ACOG (175). Over time, \\ngeneral alignment across these organizations has emerged as \\nto when to start and end cervical cancer screening as well as \\nthe periodicity of screening. Although no single guideline \\nuniversally guides screening practices in the United States, the \\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act required Medicaid \\nand new private health insurance plans to provide coverage for \\npreventive services graded A or B by USPSTF, which includes \\n\\ncervical cancer screening. In addition, the National Center for \\nQuality Assurance provides a set of measures (the Healthcare \\nEffectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS]) for up-to-\\ndate cervical cancer screening that aligns with USPSTF \\nrecommendations (https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/\\ncervical-cancer-screening). The Center for Medicaid and \\nMedicare Services uses the same measure as HEDIS to measure \\ncervical cancer screening performance.\\n\\nUSPSTF screening recommendations apply to persons with \\na cervix at average risk, defined as those with no previous \\ncervical cancer or high-grade precancer, not currently \\nunder close follow-up for a recent abnormal result, not \\nimmunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV), and who \\nhad no exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero. Among these \\npersons, screening should be performed starting at age 21 years \\nand continue through age 65 years. Testing can be performed \\nusing either conventional or liquid-based cytologic tests (i.e., \\nPap tests). For persons aged ≥30 years, screening can include \\nFDA-cleared tests for high-risk, oncogenic types of HPV. \\nFor cytopathologic testing, clinics should use CLIA-certified \\nlaboratories using acceptable terminology (Bethesda 2001 or \\nLAST terminology) (1239).\\n\\nAnnual cervical cancer screening is not recommended for \\npersons at average risk. Instead, cytology testing is recommended \\nevery 3 years for persons aged 21–29 years. For persons aged \\n30–65 years, a cytology test every 3 years, an HPV test alone \\nevery 5 years, or a cytology test plus an HPV test (cotest) every \\n5 years is recommended. Cotesting can be done by either \\ncollecting one sample for the cytology test and another for the \\nHPV test or by using the remaining liquid cytology material \\nfor the HPV test. Cervical screening programs should screen \\nthose who have received HPV vaccination in the same manner \\nas those that are unvaccinated. Screening is not recommended \\nbefore age 21 years among those at average risk. For those aged \\n30–65 years, cytology alone or primary HPV testing is preferred \\nby USPSTF; however, cotesting can be used as an alternative \\napproach. ACOG (1240), ACS (177), and USPSTF (174) each \\nhave screening recommendations (1241) (Table 1).\\n\\nClinics should weigh the benefits of each screening strategy \\nas well as their resources, such as time and cost, in deciding on \\nwhich of the three possible screening strategies to implement. \\nDecision analytic models (1242) estimating the benefits, harms, \\nand costs (1243) of several different strategies might be useful \\nin making this determination (174,1244,1245). Adopting \\nrecommended screening and follow-up procedures, including \\nscreening methods, results provision, and follow-up, can lead to \\nsuccess in implementing cervical cancer screening in clinics (1246).\\n\\nPatients should be provided a copy of their test results; \\nthose with normal results should be provided information \\non follow-up visits and the importance of continued cervical \\n\\nhttps://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/cervical-cancer-screening\\nhttps://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/cervical-cancer-screening\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 107US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nTABLE 1.

Those with abnormal screening \\ntests should be managed per published guidelines. National \\nconsensus guidelines are available for the management of \\nabnormal cervical cancer screening tests (1247). HPV testing \\nor cotesting is preferred to cytology alone for surveillance \\nafter an abnormal screening test result. These guidelines base \\nmanagement recommendations on case-by-case assessment \\nof risk considering past screening history and current results \\n(see Follow-Up). Patients with abnormal cervical cancer \\nscreening test results should be counseled about those results \\n(see Counseling Messages).\\n\\nThe following additional management considerations are \\nassociated with performing Pap tests and HPV tests:\\n\\n• Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be \\nconsidered screening tests for STIs.\\n\\n• All persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer \\nscreening, regardless of sexual orientation or gender \\nidentity (i.e., those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, \\nheterosexual, or transgender).\\n\\n• A conventional cytology test (in which the sample is \\nsmeared onto a dry slide) should ideally be scheduled for \\n10–20 days after the first day of menses. Liquid-based \\ncytology can be performed at any time during the \\nmenstrual cycle.\\n\\n• If specific infections other than HPV (e.g., chlamydia or \\ngonorrhea) are identified at the visit, a repeat cytology test \\nafter appropriate treatment for those infections might be \\nindicated. However, in most instances (even in the \\npresence of certain severe cervical infections), cytology \\ntests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and \\nreliable final reports can be produced without the need to \\nrepeat the cytology test after treatment.\\n\\n• The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not \\npostpone cytology testing. The test can be performed after \\nremoval of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.\\n\\n• HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or \\nby using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen.\\n\\n• In the absence of other indications, the presence of external \\ngenital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical \\ncancer screening.\\n\\n• The sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection \\nof other endocervical specimens does not influence Pap test \\nresults or their interpretation (600). Typically, vaginal \\nspecimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea \\nscreening; however, during a pelvic examination, endocervical \\nspecimens for STI testing can be collected first.\\n\\n• Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal \\nof the cervix do not require screening unless cervical \\nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma \\nin situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years \\n\\n(175,1247). If the cervix remains intact after a supracervical \\nhysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be \\nperformed as indicated (1248–1250).\\n\\n• Health care facilities that train providers on cytology test \\ncollection and use simple quality assurance measures are \\nmore likely to obtain satisfactory test results (as determined \\nby the laboratory).\\n\\n• The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical \\ntransformation zone (e.g., cytobrushes) improves the \\naccuracy of cytology tests (1251).\\n\\n• Both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable \\nbecause they have similar test-performance characteristics.\\n\\n• At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their \\nrecent cytology test and HPV results and any history of \\nevaluation and treatment (e.g., loop electrosurgical \\nexcision procedure and colposcopy) to assist with \\nmanagement; effort should be made to obtain copies of \\nrecent results. The importance and frequency of screening \\nshould be reinforced.\\n\\nCounseling\\nPersons might believe the cytology (Pap test) or HPV test \\n\\nscreens for conditions other than cervical cancer, or they \\nmight be confused by abnormal results (1252–1254). Health \\ncare providers, as trusted sources of information about HPV \\ninfections and abnormal cytology test results, have an important \\nrole in educating persons about HPV and can moderate the \\npsychosocial impact of abnormal results (1255,1256). Persons \\nshould be counseled on the risks, uncertainties, and benefits \\nof screening (174,1257).\\n\\nAn abnormal cytology test or a positive HPV test can \\ncause short-term anxiety, stress, fear, and confusion, possibly \\ndecreasing the patient’s ability to absorb and retain information \\nand acting as a barrier to follow-up care (1258–1261). A \\npositive HPV test might elicit concerns about partners, worries \\nabout disclosure, and feelings of guilt, anger, and stigmatization \\n(1260). Providers should frame HPV positivity in a neutral, \\nnonstigmatizing context and emphasize its common, \\nasymptomatic, and transient nature. Providers also should \\nemphasize that HPV infections often are shared between \\npartners but it is often not possible to know the origin of an \\nHPV infection; HPV tests might become positive many years \\nafter initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections \\nin both male and female partners. Having an HPV infection \\nshould not raise concerns about a male partner’s health (1262). \\nProviders should communicate the meaning of both the \\ncytology and HPV test results to patients at screening.\\n\\nProviders also should screen for tobacco use and \\nperform cessation counseling (www.acog.org/clinical/\\nclinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2011/09/\\n\\nhttps://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2011/09/tobacco-use-and-womens-health\\nhttps://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2011/09/tobacco-use-and-womens-health\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 109US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ntobacco-use-and-womens-health). Smoking contributes to \\nthe progression of CIN, with both active and passive smoking \\nassociated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix in \\nwomen with HPV 16 or 18 infection (1263–1266).\\n\\nPromoting Cervical Cancer Screening\\nClinics can use the evidence-based interventions in the \\n\\nCommunity Preventive Services Task Force guidelines to \\npromote cervical cancer screening in their communities \\n(https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/cancer-\\nscreening-multicomponent-interventions-cervical-cancer). \\nImplementing interventions that increase community demand \\nfor screening (1266) (e.g., client reminders, client incentives, \\nmedia, group education, or one-on-one education) together \\nwith those that increase community access to screening (e.g., \\nreducing structural barriers and reducing client out-of-pocket \\ncosts) is effective in increasing cervical cancer screening \\ncoverage. These interventions are more effective if they are \\nimplemented with interventions to increase provider delivery \\nof screening services (e.g., provider assessment and feedback, \\nprovider incentives, and provider reminders). Print materials \\nand online resources are available at https://www.cdc.gov/\\ncancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm and https://www.\\ncdc.gov/std/hpv/facts-brochures.htm. Patient navigators can \\nbe effective in improving both screening and follow-up after \\nabnormal results (1267).\\n\\nKey Messages About Cervical Cancer Screening\\nWhen counseling persons about cervical cancer screening, \\n\\nthe provider should discuss the following:\\n• Cervical cancer can be prevented with regular screening tests, \\n\\nlike the Pap test (cytology) and HPV tests. Those at average \\nrisk should start getting cytology tests at age 21 years.\\n\\n• The cytology test can find abnormal cervical cells, which \\ncould lead to cervical cancer over time, and an HPV test \\ndetects HPV infection of the cervix. The HPV test can be \\nused alone for cervical cancer screening or at the same time \\nas the cytology test (known as cotesting) for those aged \\n≥30 years to 65 years. The HPV test is also used after a \\ncytology test result of atypical squamous cells of \\nundetermined significance (ASC-US) among persons aged \\n>25 years (known as reflex HPV testing).\\n\\n• Positive cytology and HPV tests are markers of cervical \\nprecancerous lesions, which often do not cause symptoms \\nuntil they become invasive. Appropriate follow-up is \\nessential to ensure that cervical cancer does not develop.\\n\\n• HPV is a common infection and is often controlled by \\nthe body without any medical interventions. A positive \\nHPV test does not mean that a person has cancer.\\n\\n• Providers should emphasize that HPV infections often are \\nshared between partners, and it is often not possible to know \\nthe origin of an HPV infection; HPV tests might become \\npositive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation \\nof latent infections in both male and female partners.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nThe benefit of disclosing a positive HPV test to current \\n\\nand future sex partners is unclear. The following counseling \\nmessages can be communicated to sex partners:\\n\\n• Sex partners do not need to be tested for HPV.\\n• Sex partners tend to share HPV. Sex partners of persons \\n\\nwith HPV infection also are likely have an HPV infection.\\n• Female sex partners of men who disclose they had a previous \\n\\nfemale partner with HPV should be screened at the same \\nintervals as women with average risk. No data are available \\nto suggest that more frequent screening is of benefit.\\n\\n• When used correctly and consistently, condoms might \\nlower the risk for HPV infection and might decrease the \\ntime to clear in those with HPV infection. However, HPV \\ncan infect areas not covered by the condom, and condoms \\nmight not fully protect against HPV (24,25).\\n\\nAdditional messages for partners include the messages for persons \\nwith HPV (see Cervical Cancer Screening; Counseling Messages).\\n\\nScreening Recommendations in Special \\nPopulations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nPersons who are pregnant should be screened at the same \\n\\nintervals as those who are not. A swab, Ayre’s spatula, or \\ncytobrush can be used for obtaining cytology test samples \\nduring pregnancy (1268–1270).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nSeveral studies have documented an increased risk for cervical \\n\\nprecancers and cancers in individuals with HIV infection \\n(1271–1273). Adolescents with HIV should be screened 1 year \\nafter onset of sexual activity but no later than age 21 years. \\nSexually active persons should be screened at the time of the \\ninitial HIV diagnosis. Conventional or liquid-based cytology \\n(Pap test) should be used as primary HPV testing and is not \\nrecommended in individuals with HIV. Cotesting (cytology \\nand HPV test) can be done in individuals aged ≥30 years with \\nHIV. Annual screening is recommended for persons with HIV \\ninfection; after 3 years of consecutive normal cytology results \\nor normal cotest (normal cytology and negative HPV test), the \\nscreening interval can be increased to every 3 years. Lifelong \\nscreening is recommended among persons with HIV infection.\\n\\nhttps://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2011/09/tobacco-use-and-womens-health\\nhttps://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/cancer-screening-multicomponent-interventions-cervical-cancer\\nhttps://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/cancer-screening-multicomponent-interventions-cervical-cancer\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/facts-brochures.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/facts-brochures.htm\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n110 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nProviders should defer to existing Guidelines for the Prevention \\nand Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and \\nAdolescents with HIV for guidance on cervical cancer screening \\nand management of results in persons with HIV (98).\\n\\nAdolescents\\nPrevalence of HPV infection is high among those aged \\n\\n<21 years (174); however, HPV infections and squamous \\nintraepithelial lesions caused by HPV in adolescents are more \\nlikely to regress than those in older persons. For these reasons, \\ncervical cancer screening and HPV testing are not recommended \\nin immunocompetent adolescents. However, for adolescents \\nwith HIV infection, providers should screen 1 year after onset of \\nsexual activity, regardless of age or mode of HIV acquisition (e.g., \\nperinatally acquired or sexually acquired) (98); such screening \\nis warranted because of the reported high rate of progression of \\nabnormal cytology in adolescents with HIV.\\n\\nHuman Papillomavirus Tests for Cervical \\nCancer Screening\\n\\nClinical tests for HPV are used for the following: cervical \\ncancer screening as a primary test, cervical cancer screening \\nwith a cytology test, triage of some abnormal cervical \\ncytology results, follow-up after abnormal screening test \\nresults, follow-up after a colposcopy in which no CIN 2 or \\nCIN 3 is found, and follow-up after treatment of cervical \\nprecancers. These tests are only FDA cleared for use with \\ncervical specimens, not oral or anal specimens. Testing \\nfor nononcogenic HPV types (e.g., types 6 and 11) is not \\nrecommended (https://www.asccp.org/guidelines).\\n\\nFDA-cleared HPV tests detect viral DNA or messenger \\nRNA. Several FDA-cleared tests for HPV are available for \\nuse in the United States. The Cobas 4800 HPV test (Roche \\nMolecular Diagnostics) and the Onclarity HPV test (Becton \\nDickinson) can detect the presence of 14 oncogenic HPV types \\n(types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and \\n68), as well as individual types 16 and 18, and are cleared for \\nprimary cervical cancer screening.\\n\\nOther HPV tests are cleared for use in conjunction with \\na cytology test or to triage some abnormal cervical cytology \\nresults; they should not be used for primary HPV testing \\nbecause they are not cleared for this purpose. These tests \\ninclude the Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test \\n(Qiagen), the Cervista HPV High-Risk DNA and HPV 16/18 \\nDNA tests (Hologics), and the APTIMA HR HPV (Gen \\nProbe) test. All HPV assays should be FDA cleared and used \\nonly for the appropriate indications (https://www.fda.gov/\\nmedia/122799/download) (158).\\n\\nHPV testing should not be performed in the following situations:\\n• Deciding whether to vaccinate against HPV\\n\\n• Conducting HPV tests for low-risk (nononcogenic) HPV \\ntypes (e.g., types 6 and 11)\\n\\n• Providing care to persons with genital warts or their partners\\n• Testing persons aged <25 years as part of routine cervical \\n\\ncancer screening\\n• Testing oral or anal specimens\\nUnlike cytology, samples for HPV testing have the potential \\n\\nto be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs \\nfor analysis, thus self-collection might be one strategy for \\nincreasing screening rates among populations where screening \\nrates are low. Self-collection for HPV testing is not cleared by \\nFDA or recommended by U.S. medical organizations (174).\\n\\nFollow-Up of Abnormal Cytology and Human \\nPapillomavirus Test Results\\n\\nIf the result of the cytology (Pap test) is abnormal, follow-up \\ncare should be provided according to the 2019 ASCCP Risk-\\nBased Management Consensus Guidelines for Abnormal Cervical \\nCancer Screening Tests and Cancer Precursors (158). Clinics that \\nserve clients who might have difficulty adhering to follow-up \\nrecommendations and for whom linkage to care is unlikely should \\nconsider offering in-house colposcopy and biopsy services.\\n\\nConsensus guidelines for management of abnormal \\ncervical cancer screening tests combine patient-level risk \\ndata with clinical action thresholds to generate personalized \\nmanagement recommendations (Table 2). This framework \\nallows management on the basis of risk for CIN 3, not specific \\ntest results. The guidelines were designed to identify persons at \\nhigh risk who require colposcopy or expedited treatment and \\npersons at low risk who might be able to safely defer invasive \\ndiagnostic procedures. The risk-based framework was designed \\nto easily incorporate future revisions, such as the inclusion of \\nnew technologies for screening and management. Use of the \\nguidelines can be facilitated by electronic technology that is \\ncontinually updated, such as a smartphone application or the \\nwebsite (https://www.asccp.org/Default.aspx). \\n\\nThe following are highlights of the new management guidelines:\\n• Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk.\\n\\n ű If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e., \\nnegative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV \\npositive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) \\nthat was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or \\ncotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead \\nof colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or \\ncotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results \\nwould not similarly reduce risk).\\n\\n ű Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test \\nresults are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the \\n1-year follow-up visit.\\n\\n• Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.\\n\\nhttps://www.asccp.org/guidelines\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/122799/download\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/122799/download\\nhttps://www.asccp.org/Default.aspx\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 111US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n ű If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result \\n(i.e., HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV \\ntype 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical \\nexcision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy \\nwith biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first.\\n\\n ű If a patient who has not been screened in more than \\n5 years (i.e., rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result \\nand a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then \\ntreatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with \\nbiopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first.\\n\\n ű When considering treatment without confirmatory \\nbiopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is \\nimportant. Considerations include age, concern about \\ncancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and \\n\\nconcerns about the potential effect of treatment on a \\nfuture pregnancy.\\n\\n• When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology \\ntesting should be performed for all positive HPV test \\nresults to help determine the next steps in management.\\n\\n ű Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the \\nlaboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the \\npatient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy \\nis recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types \\n16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for \\nthe patient to return for cytology alone (1274).\\n\\n ű HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited \\ntreatment should be considered for HSIL cytology \\nresults, and colposcopy is recommended in all other \\ncases, even if the cytology test is normal.\\n\\nTABLE 2.

Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared \\n\\ndecision-making.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n112 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n ű HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, \\nand colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the \\ncytology test is normal. Because of the association of \\nHPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling \\nis acceptable at the time of colposcopy.\\n\\n ű If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test \\nis normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.\\n\\n• HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing \\nalone for follow-up after an abnormal test result.\\n\\n ű Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss \\ndisease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, \\ncytology testing is recommended more often than HPV \\ntesting or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. \\nSpecifically, cytology testing is recommended annually \\nwhen HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at \\n3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended \\nat 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is \\nrecommended annually.\\n\\n•  After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or \\nsevere dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least \\n25 years.\\n\\n ű Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, \\nand 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should \\noccur at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months.\\n\\n ű After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance \\nincludes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or \\ncotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone.\\n\\n ű Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after \\nthe initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age \\n65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the \\nsurveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.\\n\\nAnal Cancer\\nAnal cancer is rare in the general population (1–2 cases per \\n\\n100,000 person-years); however, incidence is substantially \\nhigher among specific populations, including MSM with HIV \\ninfection (80–131 cases per 100,000 person-years), men with \\nHIV infection (40–60 cases per 100,000 person-years), women \\nwith HIV infection (20–30 cases per 100,000 person-years), \\nand MSM without HIV infection (14 cases per 100,000 \\nperson-years) (1275–1279). Incidence is variable among \\nwomen with previous HPV-related gynecologic dysplasia and \\ncancer (6–63 cases per 100,000 person-years) (1280,1281). \\nPersistent HPV infection might be a risk factor for preventable \\nHPV-associated second primary cancers among survivors of \\nHPV-associated cancers (1282).\\n\\nData are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer \\nscreening with anal cytology in persons with HIV infection, \\nMSM without HIV infection, and the general population. An \\nannual digital anorectal examination (DARE) might be useful \\n\\nto detect masses on palpation in persons with HIV infection \\nand possibly in MSM without HIV with a history of receptive \\nanal intercourse (98). More evidence is needed concerning \\nthe natural history of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the best \\nscreening methods and target populations, the safety and \\nresponse to treatments, and other programmatic considerations \\nbefore screening can be routinely recommended.\\n\\nPopulations at High Risk and Digital Anorectal \\nExamination\\n\\nProviders should discuss anal cancer risk with their patients \\namong specific populations to guide management. According \\nto the HIV Opportunistic Infection guidelines and the \\nInternational Anal Neoplasia Society, a DARE should be \\nperformed to detect early anal cancer in persons with HIV \\ninfection and MSM without HIV with a history of receptive \\nanal intercourse (98,1283). DARE is acceptable to patients and \\nhas a low risk for adverse outcomes (1284,1285).\\n\\nData are insufficient to guide initiation of DARE at a defined \\nage or optimal intervals for examination. Whereas anal HSIL \\nis observed among young adults, cancer incidence begins \\nto increase after the early 30s and continues to increase as a \\nfunction of age.\\n\\nPopulations at High Risk and Anal Cytology\\nData are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer \\n\\nscreening with anal cytology among populations at risk for \\nanal cancer. Certain clinical centers perform anal cytology to \\nscreen for anal cancer among populations at high risk (e.g., \\npersons with HIV infection, MSM, and those having receptive \\nanal intercourse), followed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) \\nfor those with abnormal cytologic results (e.g., ACS-US, LSIL, \\nor HSIL). Sensitivity and specificity of anal cytology to detect \\nHSIL are limited (sensitivity 55%–89% and specificity 40%–\\n67%) (1286–1291). Health centers that initiate a cytology-\\nbased screening program should only do so if referrals to HRA \\nand biopsy are available.\\n\\nHRA can be used for diagnosis of HSIL, to monitor response \\nto therapy, or to conduct surveillance of HSIL for evidence of \\nprogression. HRA is the primary method used for diagnosis of \\nsuperficially invasive squamous carcinoma, a very early form of \\nanal cancer that is not palpable on DARE. However, data are \\ninsufficient to conclude whether use of HRA leads to reductions \\nin anal cancer incidence or improves anal cancer morbidity and \\nmortality. An ongoing clinical trial is investigating whether \\ntreatment of HSIL is effective in reducing the incidence of anal \\ncancer among persons with HIV infection (NCT02135419).\\n\\nHuman Papillomavirus Testing\\nHPV tests (using high-risk HPV types) are not clinically \\n\\nuseful for anal cancer screening because of a high prevalence \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 113US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nof anal HPV infection among populations at high risk, \\nparticularly MSM (1278,1289,1290). No standard HPV-based \\nalgorithms exist for anal cancer screening due to the high \\nprevalence of high-risk HPV infection among groups at risk.\\n\\nTreatment of Anal High-Grade Squamous \\nIntraepithelial Lesion\\n\\nMultiple office-based treatments exist for anal HSIL, \\nincluding ablative methods (e.g., laser, electrocautery, or \\ninfrared coagulation) and topical patient-applied therapies \\n(e.g., imiquimod). Recurrence rates with both provider-\\napplied and patient-applied treatments are high, ranging \\nfrom approximately 50% at 1 year to 77% after 3 years \\n(1289,1292,1293). In addition, evidence exists that HSIL \\nmight spontaneously regress without treatment (1294,1295). \\nShared decision-making about treatment for anal HSIL is \\nrecommended because of limited data on the natural history \\nof anal HSIL, including factors related to progression or \\nregression of lesions.\\n\\nViral Hepatitis\\nHepatitis A Virus Infection\\n\\nHAV infection has an incubation period of approximately \\n28 days (range: 15–50 days) (1296). HAV replicates in the liver \\nand is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2–3 weeks \\nbefore to 1 week after the onset of clinical illness. HAV infection \\nproduces a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic \\ninfection or chronic liver disease. However, approximately \\n10% of patients experience a relapse of symptoms during \\nthe 6 months after acute illness. Acute liver failure from \\nhepatitis A is rare (overall case-fatality rate: 0.5%). The risk \\nfor symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with \\napproximately 70% of adults having symptoms compatible \\nwith acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having \\neither asymptomatic or unrecognized infection. Antibody \\nproduced in response to HAV infection persists for life and \\nconfers protection against reinfection (1297).\\n\\nHAV infection is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, \\nby either person-to-person contact or through consumption \\nof contaminated food or water (1298). Transmission of HAV \\nduring sexual activity probably results from fecal-oral contact. \\nAlthough viremia occurs early during infection and can persist \\nfor weeks after symptom onset, bloodborne transmission of \\nHAV is uncommon (1299). Transmission by saliva has not \\nbeen demonstrated.\\n\\nIn the United States, of the hepatitis A cases accompanied by \\nrisk information, a particular risk was identified among only \\n23.8% (13,372). Among cases with a risk factor identified, a \\n\\nrecognized foodborne or waterborne outbreak was the most \\ncommonly identified risk (49.6%). Other infection sources \\nidentified in the United States include MSM; persons who \\nuse injecting drugs; sexual and household contacts; those \\nexperiencing homelessness; international travelers; those with \\nchildren attending a nursery, childcare, or preschool; and \\npersons working in such settings (13,372).\\n\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nDiagnosis of HAV infection cannot be made on a clinical \\n\\nbasis alone but requires serologic testing. Presence of IgM \\nantibody to HAV is diagnostic of acute HAV infection. A \\npositive test for total anti-HAV indicates immunity to HAV \\ninfection but does not differentiate current from previous HAV \\ninfection. Although usually not sensitive enough to detect the \\nlow level of protective antibody after vaccination, anti-HAV \\ntests also might be positive after hepatitis A vaccination.\\n\\nTreatment\\nPatients with acute HAV infection usually require only \\n\\nsupportive care, with no restrictions in diet or activity. \\nHospitalization might be necessary for patients who become \\ndehydrated because of nausea and vomiting and is crucial \\nfor patients with signs or symptoms of acute liver failure. \\nMedications that might cause liver damage or are metabolized \\nby the liver should be used with caution among persons with \\nHAV infection.\\n\\nPrevention\\nVaccination is the most effective means of preventing HAV \\n\\ntransmission among persons at risk for infection (e.g., MSM, \\ninjecting drug users, and persons with chronic liver disease) \\nwho did not receive hepatitis A vaccination during childhood. \\nHepatitis A vaccines are prepared from formalin-inactivated, \\ncell-culture–derived HAV. Two monovalent vaccines (Havrix \\nand Vaqta are approved by FDA for persons aged ≥12 months \\n(Table 3). These vaccines are available for eligible children \\nand adolescents aged <19 years through the VFC program \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html). \\nAdministered IM in a 2-dose series at 0 and 6–12 months, \\nhepatitis A vaccines induce protective antibody levels among \\nvirtually all adults. By 1 month after the first dose, 94%–100% \\nof adults have protective antibody levels, and after a second \\ndose, 100% achieve protective levels (1297,1300,1301). \\nKinetic models of antibody decrease among adults indicate that \\nprotective levels persist for >40 years (1302–1304). A study of \\nAlaska Natives demonstrated that seropositivity for hepatitis \\nA persists for >20 years after completing 2-dose vaccination at \\nage 12–21 months (1302). Anti-HAV persistence of >20 years \\nwas demonstrated among immunocompetent adults vaccinated \\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n114 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nwith a 2-dose hepatitis A schedule as adults (1303,1305). A \\ncombined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) has \\nbeen developed and licensed for use as a 3-dose series for \\nadults aged ≥18 years at risk for HAV or HBV infections. \\nWhen administered IM on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule, \\nthe vaccine has equivalent immunogenicity to that of the \\nmonovalent hepatitis A vaccines.\\n\\nPre-Exposure Vaccination\\nPersons at risk for HAV infection (Box 5) (1297) should be \\n\\noffered vaccine (Table 3). If persons are at risk for both HAV \\nand HBV, the combined vaccine can be considered.\\n\\nPrevaccination Serologic Testing\\nAmong U.S.-born adults aged >20 years, HAV susceptibility \\n\\nprevalence (i.e., total antibody to HAV was negative) was \\n74.1% (95% CI:\\xa072.9%–75.3%) during 2007–2016 (1306).\\nPrevaccination serologic testing for HAV immunity before \\nvaccination is not routinely recommended; however, it can be \\nconsidered in specific settings to reduce costs by not vaccinating \\npersons who are already immune. Prevaccination serologic \\ntesting should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible \\npersons, especially for populations that are difficult to access. If \\nprevaccination testing is performed, commercially available tests \\nfor total anti-HAV or IgG anti-HAV should be used (1297).\\n\\nBOX 5.

Prevaccination serologic testing \\nof children is not indicated because of the low prevalence of \\ninfection among that age group.\\n\\nFor populations who are expected to have high rates of previous \\nHAV infection, vaccination history should be obtained when \\nfeasible before testing or vaccination. Vaccination should not be \\npostponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained, records are \\nunavailable, or prevaccination testing is infeasible. Vaccinating \\npersons immune from natural infection carries no known risk, nor \\ndoes giving extra doses of hepatitis A vaccine (1307). Vaccination \\nof a person who is already immune is not harmful. Persons who \\nhave a documented history of ≥2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine do \\nnot need further vaccination or serologic testing.\\n\\nPostvaccination Serologic Testing\\nSerologic testing for immunity is unnecessary after routine \\n\\nvaccination of infants, children, or adults (1297). Testing \\nfor anti-HAV antibody after vaccination is recommended \\nfor persons whose subsequent clinical management depends \\non knowledge of their immune status and persons for whom \\nrevaccination might be indicated (e.g., persons with HIV \\ninfection and other immunocompromising conditions).\\n\\nPostexposure Prophylaxis\\nPersons who recently have been exposed to HAV and who \\n\\npreviously have not received hepatitis A vaccine should be \\nadministered a single dose of monovalent hepatitis A vaccine \\nor immunoglobulin (IG) (0.1 mL/kg body weight) as soon as \\npossible, ideally <2 weeks after exposure because the efficacy \\nof vaccine or IG when administered >2 weeks after exposure \\nhas not been established (1297). In most cases, monovalent \\nhepatitis A vaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred \\nover IG for PEP. Advantages of hepatitis A vaccine for PEP \\ninclude induction of active immunity, longer-term protection, \\nease of administration, and better acceptability and availability. \\nDecisions to use vaccine versus IG should be guided by patient \\ncharacteristics associated with more severe manifestations \\nof HAV infection (e.g., older age, immunocompromising \\nconditions, and chronic liver disease) and the magnitude of the \\nrisk for HAV transmission resulting from the exposure (1297).\\n\\nIG should be used for children aged <6 months, \\nimmunocompromised persons, persons with chronic liver \\ndisease, and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated.

In the United States, IG is produced only from \\nplasma that has tested negative for HBsAg, antibodies to HIV \\nand HCV, and HIV and HCV RNA. In addition, the process \\nused to manufacture IG inactivates viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV, \\nand HIV). When administered IM <2 weeks after exposure to \\nHAV, IG is >85% effective in preventing HAV infection (1308).\\n\\nIf IG is administered to persons for whom hepatitis A vaccine \\nalso is recommended, a dose of vaccine should be provided \\nsimultaneously with IG in different anatomic sites (e.g., \\ndifferent limbs) as soon as possible, and the second vaccine dose \\nshould be administered according to the licensed schedule to \\ncomplete the series. The combined vaccine can be considered \\nfor persons among whom both hepatitis A and hepatitis B \\nvaccine is recommended (13,1297,1302–1304).\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\nFor persons with HIV infection, antibody response can be \\n\\ndirectly related to CD4+ T-cell levels. Although persons with \\nHIV who have lower CD4+ T-cell counts or percentages might \\nhave a weaker response to the vaccine, vaccination should \\nnot be delayed for the CD4+ T-cell count to exceed a certain \\nthreshold because of the prolonged risk for HAV exposure \\ncreated by missed opportunities to vaccinate.\\n\\nHepatitis B Virus Infection\\nThe incubation period for HBV infection from time of \\n\\nexposure to symptom onset ranges from 6 weeks to 6 months. \\nThe highest concentrations of HBV are located in blood, with \\nlower concentrations in other body fluids including wound \\nexudates, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva (1309,1310). \\nHBV is more infectious and more stable in the environment \\nthan other bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HCV or HIV).\\n\\nHBV infection can be either self-limited or chronic. \\nAmong adults, approximately half of newly acquired HBV \\ninfections are symptomatic, and approximately 1% of reported \\ncases result in acute liver failure and death (1311). Risk for \\nchronic infection is inversely related to age at acquisition; \\napproximately 90% of infected infants and 30% of infected \\nchildren aged <5 years become chronically infected, compared \\nwith 2%–6% of persons who become infected as adults (1312). \\nAmong persons with chronic HBV infection, the risk for \\npremature death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma \\nis 15%–25% (1313).\\n\\nHBV is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous \\nmembrane exposure to HBV-infected blood or body fluids \\nthat contain HBV. The primary risk factors associated with \\ninfection among adolescents and adults are unprotected sex \\nwith an infected partner, having multiple partners, men having \\n\\nsex with men, having history of other STIs, and injecting drug \\nuse (233). In addition, studies have demonstrated other modes \\nof HBV transmission, including premastication and lapses \\nin health care infection control procedures, as less common \\nsources of transmission (1314–1317).\\n\\nCDC’s national strategy for eliminating transmission of HBV \\ninfection includes prevention of perinatal infection through \\nroutine screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg and \\nimmunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with HBsAg \\nor mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown, routine infant \\nvaccination, vaccination of previously unvaccinated children \\nand adolescents through age 18 years, and vaccination of \\npreviously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection \\n(12). High vaccination coverage rates with subsequent \\ndecreases in acute HBV infection incidence have been achieved \\namong infants and adolescents (1318). The vaccination of \\npersons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved \\nvaccination coverage among adults aged <30 years (1319) and \\ncorresponding lower rates of acute HBV infection among this \\ngroup. In contrast, vaccination coverage among the majority \\nof adult populations at high risk aged ≥30 years (e.g., persons \\nwith multiple sex partners, MSM, and injecting drug users) \\nhas remained low (1320,1321); these groups account for the \\nhighest rates of preventable acute infections (12,1319,1322). \\nSTD clinics and other health care settings providing STI \\nservices to adults at high risk for infection should administer \\nhepatitis B vaccine to those who are unvaccinated.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires \\n\\nserologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both \\nacute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to \\nhepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute \\nor recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg \\n(anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the \\nonly HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The \\npresence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM \\nanti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of \\ntotal anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic \\ninfection or a false-positive result.\\n\\nTreatment\\nNo specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV \\n\\ninfection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic \\nHBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider \\nexperienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents \\napproved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection \\ncan achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and \\nremission of liver disease (1323).\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 117US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nPrevention\\nTwo products have been approved for HBV prevention: \\n\\nhepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for PEP and hepatitis \\nB vaccine (12). HBIG provides temporary (i.e., 3–6 months) \\nprotection from HBV infection and is typically used as \\nPEP as an adjunct to hepatitis B vaccination for previously \\nunvaccinated persons or for persons who have not responded to \\nvaccination. HBIG is prepared from plasma known to contain \\nhigh concentrations of anti-HBs. The recommended dose of \\nHBIG is 0.06 mL/kg body weight.\\n\\nHepatitis B vaccine contains HBsAg produced in yeast by \\nrecombinant DNA technology and provides protection from \\nHBV infection when used for both pre-exposure vaccination \\nand PEP. The three available monovalent hepatitis B vaccines \\nfor use in the United States are Recombivax HB, Engerix-B, \\nand Heplisav-B. A combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B \\nvaccine for use among persons aged ≥18 years, Twinrix, also \\nis available.\\n\\nWhen selecting a hepatitis B vaccination schedule, health care \\nproviders should consider the need to achieve completion of \\nthe vaccine series. The recommended HBV dose and schedule \\nvaries by product and age of recipient (Table 6). Three different \\n3-dose schedules for adolescents and adults have been approved \\nfor both monovalent hepatitis B vaccines (i.e., Engerix-B and \\nRecombivax HB); these vaccines can be administered at 0, 1, \\nand 6 months; 0, 1, and 4 months; or 0, 2, and 4 months. \\nA 4-dose schedule of Engerix-B at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months is \\nlicensed for all age groups. A 2-dose schedule of Recombivax \\nHB adult formulation (10 µg) is licensed for adolescents \\naged 11–15 years, with a 4-month minimal interval between \\ndoses. When scheduled to receive the second dose, adolescents \\n\\naged 16–19 years should be switched to a 3-dose series, with \\ndoses 2 and 3 consisting of the pediatric formulation (5 µg) \\nadministered on a recommended schedule. Heplisav-B is a \\nnew single-antigen recombinant hepatitis B vaccine with a \\nnovel cytosine-phosphate-guanine 1018 oligodeoxynucleotide \\nadjuvant for prevention of HBV infection among persons \\naged ≥18 years, administered as a 2-dose series at 0 and \\n1 month (>4 weeks apart) (156). Twinrix is a 3-dose schedule \\nadministered at 0, 1, and 6 months to persons aged ≥18 years \\nat risk for both HAV and HBV infections.\\n\\nHepatitis B vaccine should be administered IM in the deltoid \\nmuscle and can be administered simultaneously with other \\nvaccines. If the vaccine series is interrupted after the first or \\nsecond dose of vaccine, the missed dose should be administered \\nas soon as possible. The series does not need to be restarted after \\na missed dose. HBV vaccination is available for eligible children \\nand adolescents aged <19 years through the VFC program \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/contacts-state.\\nhtml). When feasible, the same manufacturer’s vaccines should \\nbe used to complete the series; however, vaccination should \\nnot be deferred when the manufacturer of the previously \\nadministered vaccine is unknown or when the vaccine from \\nthe same manufacturer is unavailable (1324).\\n\\nAmong adolescents and healthy adults aged <40 years, \\napproximately 30%–55% achieve a protective antibody response \\n(i.e., anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL) after the first single-antigen \\nvaccine dose, 75% after the second, and >90% after the third. \\nRecent clinical trials reported a protective antibody response \\nachieved among approximately 90% of participants receiving \\nHeplisav-B, compared with 70.5%–90.2% of participants \\nreceiving Engerix-B (12). Vaccine-induced immune memory \\nhas been demonstrated to persist for >30 years (1325–1327). \\n\\nTABLE 5.

Pain at the injection site and low-grade \\nfever are reported by a minority of recipients. For children \\nand adolescents, a causal association exists between receipt of \\nhepatitis B vaccination and anaphylaxis. For each 1.1 million \\ndoses of vaccine administered, approximately one recipient will \\nexperience this type of reaction (1328); however, no deaths have \\nbeen reported among these patients (1318,1328). Vaccine is \\ncontraindicated for persons with a history of anaphylaxis after a \\nprevious dose of hepatitis B vaccine and persons with a known \\nanaphylactic reaction to any vaccine component (1329). No \\nother adverse events after administration of hepatitis B vaccine \\nhave been demonstrated.\\n\\nPre-Exposure Vaccination\\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated \\n\\nchildren and adolescents; all unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV \\ninfection, especially injecting drug users; MSM; adults with \\nmultiple sex partners; sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, \\nor household contacts of persons with chronic hepatitis B; \\nand persons with diabetes and all adults seeking protection \\nfrom HBV infection (1318). For adults, acknowledgment of \\na specific risk factor is not a requirement for vaccination.\\n\\nHepatitis B vaccine should be routinely offered to all \\nunvaccinated persons attending STD clinics and to all \\nunvaccinated persons seeking evaluation or treatment for STIs \\nin other settings, especially correctional facilities, facilities \\nproviding substance misuse treatment and prevention services, \\nFederally Qualified Health Centers, and settings serving MSM \\n(e.g., HIV infection care and prevention settings).

Serologic \\ntesting should not be a barrier to vaccination. The first vaccine \\ndose should be administered immediately after collection of the \\nblood sample for serologic testing. Vaccination of persons who \\nare immune to HBV infection because of current or previous \\ninfection or vaccination is not harmful and does not increase \\nthe risk for adverse events.\\n\\nPrevaccination testing should be performed with HBsAg, \\nanti-HBs, and total anti-HBc to define patients’ HBV clinical \\nstatus and deliver recommended care (1330). Persons who \\ntest HBsAg positive should receive prevention counseling and \\nevaluation for antiviral treatment (see Management of Persons \\nWho Are HBsAg Positive). Persons who test total anti-HBc \\npositive and anti-HBs positive should be counseled that they \\nhave had previous HBV infection and are immune. Those \\npersons with isolated anti-HBc (i.e., negative HBsAg and \\nanti-HBs) need further assessment to rule out occult HBV \\ninfection, and they are at higher risk for reactivation if exposed \\nto immunosuppressants. Persons who test negative to all three \\nHBV seromarkers should receive the complete vaccination \\nseries, with the first vaccine dose administered immediately.\\n\\nPostvaccination Serologic Testing for Response\\nPostvaccination serologic testing for immunity is unnecessary \\n\\nafter routine vaccination of adolescents or adults. However, \\nsuch testing is recommended for persons whose subsequent \\nclinical management depends on knowledge of their immune \\nstatus. Persons recommended to receive postvaccination \\nserologic testing include health care personnel and public safety \\nworkers, persons with HIV infection, sex and needle-sharing \\npartners of HBsAg-positive persons, hemodialysis patients \\nand others who might require outpatient hemodialysis (e.g., \\npredialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or home dialysis), and other \\nimmunocompromised persons (e.g., hematopoietic stem-cell \\ntransplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy) (1318).\\n\\nIf indicated, anti-HBs testing should be performed \\n1–2 months after administration of the last dose of the \\nvaccine series. Persons determined to have anti-HBs levels \\nof <10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be \\nrevaccinated with a 3-dose series and tested again for anti-HBs \\n1–2 months after the third dose. Persons who do not respond to \\nrevaccination should be tested for HBsAg and HBc. If HBsAg \\npositive, persons should receive recommended management \\n(see Management of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive). If \\nHBsAg negative, persons should be considered susceptible to \\nHBV infection and counseled about precautions for preventing \\nHBV infection and the need for HBIG PEP for any known \\nexposure. If isolated anti-HBc positive (i.e., negative HBsAg \\nand anti-HBs), persons will need further assessment to rule out \\n\\noccult HBV infection and are at higher risk for reactivation if \\nexposed to immunosuppressants.\\n\\nPostexposure Prophylaxis\\nBoth passive and active PEP (simultaneous administration of \\n\\nHBIG [i.e., 0.06 mL/kg body weight] and hepatitis B vaccine \\nat separate anatomic sites) and active PEP (administration of \\nhepatitis B vaccination alone) have been demonstrated to be \\nhighly effective in preventing transmission after exposure to \\nHBV (12). HBIG alone also has been demonstrated to be \\neffective in preventing HBV transmission; however, with the \\navailability of hepatitis B vaccine, HBIG typically is used as \\nan adjunct to vaccination.\\n\\nExposure to a Source Who Is HBsAg Positive\\nUnvaccinated persons or persons known not to have \\n\\nresponded to a complete hepatitis B vaccine series should \\nreceive both HBIG and hepatitis vaccine as soon as possible \\n(preferably ≤24 hours) after a discrete, identifiable exposure \\nto blood or body fluids that contain blood from a person with \\nHBsAg (Table 7). Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered \\nsimultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomic site, and the \\nvaccine series should be completed by using the age-appropriate \\nvaccine dose and schedule (Table 6). Exposed persons who \\nare not fully vaccinated because they have not completed the \\nvaccine series should receive HBIG (i.e., 0.06 mL/kg body \\nweight) and complete the vaccine series. Persons who have \\nwritten documentation of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series \\nwho did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a \\nsingle vaccine booster dose. Exposed persons who are known \\nto have responded to vaccination by postvaccination testing \\nare considered protected; therefore, they need no additional \\ndoses of vaccine or HBIG. All persons with an occupational \\nexposure to blood or body fluids that contain HBV should be \\nmanaged according to guidelines (12).\\n\\nExposure to a Source with Unknown HBsAg Status\\nUnvaccinated persons and persons with previous nonresponse \\n\\nto hepatitis B vaccination who have a discrete, identifiable \\nexposure to blood or body fluids containing blood from \\na person with unknown HBsAg status should receive the \\nhepatitis B vaccine series, with the first dose initiated as soon \\nas possible after exposure (preferably <24 hours) and the series \\ncompleted according to the age-appropriate dose and schedule. \\nExposed persons who are not fully vaccinated but started the \\nseries should complete the vaccine series.

Pregnant women at risk for HBV infection and \\nwithout documentation of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series \\nshould receive hepatitis B vaccination. All pregnant women \\nwith HBsAg should be reported to state and local perinatal \\nhepatitis B prevention programs and referred to a specialist. \\nInformation about management of pregnant women with \\nHBsAg and their infants is available at https://www.cdc.gov/\\nhepatitis/hbv/perinatalxmtn.htm.\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nHIV infection can impair the response to hepatitis B \\n\\nvaccination. Persons with HIV should be tested for anti-HBs \\n1–2 months after the third vaccine dose (see Postvaccination \\nSerologic Testing). Modified dosing regimens, including a \\ndoubling of the standard antigen dose and administration of \\nadditional doses, might increase the response rate and should be \\nmanaged in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. \\nAdditional recommendations for management of persons with \\nHBsAg and HIV infection are available (98).\\n\\nHepatitis C Virus Infection\\nHCV infection is the most common chronic bloodborne \\n\\ninfection in the United States, with an estimated 2.4 million \\npersons living with chronic infection (1332). HCV is not \\nefficiently transmitted through sex (1333–1335). Studies of \\nHCV transmission between heterosexual couples and MSM \\nhave yielded mixed results; however, studies have reported \\neither no or minimally increased rates of HCV infection \\namong partners of persons with HCV infection compared \\nwith partners of those without HCV (1334,1336–1338). \\nHowever, data indicate that sexual transmission of HCV \\ncan occur, especially among persons with HIV infection. \\nIncreasing incidence of acute HCV infection among MSM \\nwith HIV infection has been reported in multiple U.S. \\n(96,236,239,1339) and European cities (237,1340–1342). A \\nrecent systematic review reported an HCV incidence of 6.35 \\nper 1,000 person years among MSM with HIV infection \\n(1343). An association exists with high-risk and traumatic \\nsexual practices (e.g., condomless receptive anal intercourse \\nor receptive fisting) and concurrent genital ulcerative disease \\nor STI-related proctitis (237,1342). HCV transmission among \\nMSM with HIV infection has also been associated with group \\nsex and chemsex (i.e., using recreational drugs in a sexual \\ncontext) (1344–1348). Shedding of HCV in the semen and in \\nthe rectum of men with HIV infection has been documented \\n(1349,1350). Certain studies have revealed that risk increases \\ncommensurate with increasing numbers of sex partners among \\nheterosexual persons (1337,1338,1351–1353) and MSM with \\nHIV infection (1349,1354–1357), especially if their partners are \\nalso coinfected with HIV (237,1340,1354–1356,1358). More \\nrecently, acute HCV infections have been reported among MSM \\non PrEP, increasing concerns that certain MSM might be at \\nincreased risk for incident HCV infection through condomless \\nsexual intercourse with MSM with HCV infection (1359,1360).\\n\\nPersons newly infected with HCV typically are either \\nasymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness. HCV RNA can \\nbe detected in blood within 1–3 weeks after exposure. The \\naverage time from exposure to antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) \\nseroconversion is 4−10 weeks, and anti-HCV can be detected \\namong approximately 97% of persons by 6 months after \\nexposure (1361–1364) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/\\nhcvfaq.htm#section3).\\n\\nChronic HCV infection develops among 75%–85% of \\npersons with HCV infection (1365,1366), and 10%–20% of \\npersons with chronic infection develop cirrhosis in 20–30 years \\nof active liver disease (1367). The majority of infected persons \\nremain unaware of their infection because they are not clinically \\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/perinatalxmtn.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/perinatalxmtn.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm#section3\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm#section3\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n122 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nill. However, infected persons are a source of transmission to \\nothers and are at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma \\ndecades after infection.\\n\\nHCV is primarily transmitted parenterally, usually through \\nshared drug-injecting needles and paraphernalia. HCV also \\ncan be transmitted through exposures in health care settings \\nas a consequence of inadequate infection control practices \\n(1314). Transmission after receipt of blood from donors and \\nfrom transplantation of tissues and organs with HCV infection \\nhas occurred only rarely since 1992, when routine screening \\nof these donated products was mandated in the United \\nStates (1367,1369). Tattoos applied in regulated settings \\nhave not been associated with HCV transmission, although \\nthose obtained in certain settings have been linked to such \\ntransmission (1336). Occupational and perinatal exposures also \\ncan result in transmission of HCV; however, such transmission \\nis uncommon.\\n\\nAcute HCV infection is a reportable condition in 49 states. \\nMatching viral hepatitis and HIV surveillance registries, and \\nmolecular epidemiologic assessments, can facilitate early \\ndetection of social networks of HCV transmission among \\nMSM with HIV infection.\\n\\nCDC recommends hepatitis C screening at least once in a \\nlifetime for all adults aged ≥18 years and for all women during \\neach pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of \\nHCV infection is <0.1% (156). One-time hepatitis C testing \\nis also recommended regardless of age, setting, or recognized \\nconditions or exposures (e.g., HIV infection, history of \\ninjecting drug use, or children born to women with HCV \\ninfection). Routine periodic HCV testing is recommended \\nfor persons with ongoing risk factors (e.g., injecting drug use \\nor hemodialysis).\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nTesting for HCV infection should include use of an FDA-\\n\\ncleared test for antibody to HCV (i.e., immunoassay, EIA, or \\nenhanced CIA and, if recommended, a supplemental antibody \\ntest) followed by NAAT to detect HCV RNA for those with a \\npositive antibody result (1370). Persons with HIV infection with \\nlow CD4+ T-cell count might require further testing by NAAT \\nbecause of the potential for a false-negative antibody assay.\\n\\nPersons determined to have HCV infection (i.e., positive \\nfor HCV RNA) should be evaluated for treatment. Antibody \\nto HCV remains positive after spontaneously resolving or \\nsuccessful treatment; therefore, subsequent testing for HCV \\nreinfection among persons with ongoing risk factors should \\nbe limited to HCV RNA. Persons who have spontaneous \\nresolution or who have undergone successful treatment are \\nnot immune to reinfection.\\n\\nTreatment\\nHCV infection is curable, and persons with diagnosed HCV \\n\\ninfection should be linked to care and treatment. Providers \\nshould consult existing guidelines to learn about the latest \\nadvances in treating HCV infection (https://www.hcvguidelines.\\norg) and with hepatitis specialists, as needed. Persons at high \\nrisk for transmitting HCV to others should be treated both for \\nindividual benefit and to prevent HCV transmission.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nBecause incident HCV has not been demonstrated to \\n\\noccur among heterosexual couples followed over time \\n(1334,1371–1373), condom use might not be necessary in \\nsuch circumstances. Persons with HCV infection with one \\nlong-term, steady sex partner do not need to change their \\nsexual practices. However, they should discuss the risk for \\ntransmission with their partner and discuss the need for \\ntesting (234) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm). \\nHeterosexual persons and MSM with HCV infection and \\nmore than one partner, especially those with concurrent HIV \\ninfection, should protect their partners against HCV and HIV \\nacquisition by using external latex condoms (237,1358,1374) \\nand HIV PrEP. Partners of persons with HCV and HIV should \\nbe tested for both infections.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAll persons with HCV infection for whom HIV and \\n\\nHBV infection status is unknown should be tested for these \\ninfections. Those who have HIV or HBV infection should be \\nreferred for or provided with recommended care and treatment. \\nPersons without previous exposure to HAV or HBV should \\nbe vaccinated.\\n\\nPrevention\\nReducing the burden of HCV infection and disease in \\n\\nthe United States requires implementing both primary and \\nsecondary prevention activities. Primary prevention reduces or \\neliminates HCV transmission, whereas secondary prevention \\nidentifies persons through screening and then provides \\ntreatment to reduce chronic liver disease and other chronic \\ndiseases and HCV transmission. No vaccine for hepatitis \\nC is available, and prophylaxis with IG is not effective in \\npreventing HCV infection after exposure. PEP using direct-\\nacting antivirals is not recommended.\\n\\nPersons with HCV infection should be provided information \\nabout how to protect their liver from further harm (i.e., \\nhepatotoxic agents); for instance, persons with HCV infection \\nshould be advised to avoid drinking alcohol and taking any new \\nmedicines, including over-the-counter or herbal medications, \\nwithout checking with their clinician. In addition, a need for \\n\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 123US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nhepatitis A and B vaccination should be determined; persons \\nwho are not immune should be vaccinated.\\n\\nTo reduce the risk for transmission to others, persons with HCV \\ninfection should be advised not to donate blood, body organs, \\nother tissue, or semen; not to share any personal items that might \\nhave blood on them (e.g., toothbrushes or razors); and to cover \\ncuts and sores on the skin to keep the virus from spreading by \\nblood or secretions. Women with HCV infection do not need \\nto avoid pregnancy or breastfeeding, although children born to \\nwomen with HCV also should be tested for HCV.\\n\\nPersons who use or inject drugs should be counseled about \\nthe importance of prevention and provided access to substance \\nmisuse treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, \\nif indicated. Persons who inject drugs should be encouraged \\nto take the following additional steps to reduce personal and \\npublic health risks:\\n\\n• Never reuse or share syringes, water, or drug preparation \\nequipment.\\n\\n• Only use syringes obtained from a reliable source (e.g., a \\nsyringe services program or a pharmacy).\\n\\n• Use a new, sterile syringe to prepare and inject drugs each time.\\n• If possible, use sterile water to prepare drugs; otherwise, \\n\\nuse clean water from a reliable source (e.g., fresh tap water).\\n• Use a new or disinfected container (i.e., cooker) and a new \\n\\nfilter (i.e., cotton) to prepare drugs.\\n• Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab before \\n\\ninjection.\\n• Safely dispose of syringes after one use.\\n\\nPostexposure Follow-Up\\nNo PEP has been demonstrated to be effective against HCV \\n\\ninfection. Testing for HCV is recommended for health care \\nworkers after percutaneous or perimucosal exposures to HCV-\\npositive blood. Prompt identification of acute infection is vital \\nbecause outcomes are improved when treatment is initiated \\nearly during the illness course.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nAll pregnant women should be screened with each pregnancy \\n\\nfor HCV antibodies at the first prenatal visit in settings \\nwhere the HCV prevalence is >0.1% (https://www.cdc.gov/\\nhepatitis/hcv/index.htm) (154,155). Although the rate of \\ntransmission is highly variable, more than six of every 100 \\ninfants born to women with HCV infection become infected; \\nthis infection occurs predominantly during or near delivery, \\nand no treatment or delivery method (e.g., cesarean delivery) \\nhas been demonstrated to decrease this risk (1375). However, \\nthe risk is increased by the presence of maternal HCV viremia \\n\\nat delivery and is twofold to threefold greater if the woman has \\nHIV infection. Although no recommendations are available \\nfor HCV treatment during pregnancy, discussion about the \\nindividual risks and benefits of postpartum treatment can be \\nconsidered in accordance with existing guidance (https://www.\\nhcvguidelines.org/unique-populations/pregnancy).\\n\\nHCV has not been reported to be transmitted through breast \\nmilk, although mothers with HCV infection should consider \\nabstaining from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or \\nbleeding. Infants born to mothers with HCV infection should \\nbe tested for HCV infection; children should be tested for \\nanti-HCV no sooner than age 18 months because anti-HCV \\nfrom the mother might last until that age. If diagnosis is desired \\nbefore the child reaches age 18 months, testing for HCV \\nRNA can be performed at or after the infant’s first well-child \\nvisit at age 1–2 months. HCV RNA testing can be repeated \\nat a subsequent visit, independent of the initial HCV RNA \\ntest result (1376) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.\\nhtm#section3).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nAll persons with HIV infection should undergo serologic \\n\\nscreening for HCV at initial evaluation (98) (https://www.\\nhcvguidelines.org). Providers should be aware of the likelihood \\nthat MSM with HIV infection can acquire HCV after initial \\nscreening. Because acute HCV infection acquisition among \\npersons with HIV infection can occur, especially among \\nMSM, and regular screening of those with HIV is cost-\\neffective (238,239,1377), periodic HCV screening should be \\nconducted (1378–1380). For persons with HIV infection, \\nhepatitis C screening with HCV antibody assays (followed \\nby HCV RNA if antibody positive) can be considered at least \\nyearly, for those at high risk for infection, and more frequently \\ndepending on specific circumstances (e.g., community HCV \\ninfection prevalence and incidence, high-risk sexual behavior, \\nand concomitant ulcerative STIs and proctitis). Antibody to \\nHCV remains positive after spontaneously resolved infection \\nor successful treatment; therefore, subsequent testing for \\npotential HCV reinfection among persons with ongoing risk \\nshould be limited to HCV RNA testing only. Indirect testing \\n(e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) is not recommended \\nfor detecting incident HCV infections because such testing, \\nespecially if performed once a year, can miss persons who have \\nreverted after acute HCV infection to a normal ALT level at \\nthe time of testing (239) (https://www.hcvguidelines.org). \\nConversely, ALT can be elevated by antiretroviral and other \\nmedications, alcohol, and toxins. If ALT levels are being \\nmonitored, persons with HIV infection who experience new \\nor unexplained increases in ALT should be tested for acute \\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm#section3\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm#section3\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org\\nhttps://www.hcvguidelines.org\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n124 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nHCV infection and evaluated for possible medication toxicity \\nor excessive alcohol use.\\n\\nContinued unprotected sexual contact between partners \\nwith HIV can facilitate spread of HCV infection because \\nthe virus can be recovered from the semen of men with HIV \\ninfection (1349,1381). Specific prevention practices (e.g., \\nbarrier precautions that limit contact with body fluids during \\nsexual contact with other MSM) should be discussed.\\n\\nBecause a minimal percentage of persons with HIV infection \\ndo not develop HCV antibodies, HCV RNA testing should \\nbe performed for persons with HIV infection and unexplained \\nliver disease who are anti-HCV negative. The course of liver \\ndisease is more rapid among persons with HIV and HCV, and \\nthe risk for cirrhosis is higher than that for persons with HCV \\ninfection alone.\\n\\nProctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis\\nSexually transmitted gastrointestinal syndromes include \\n\\nproctitis, proctocolitis, and enteritis. Evaluation for these \\nsyndromes should include recommended diagnostic \\nprocedures, including anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, stool \\nexamination for WBCs, and microbiologic workup (e.g., \\ngonorrhea, chlamydia [LGV PCR if available], herpes simplex \\nNAAT, and syphilis serology). For those with enteritis, stool \\nculture or LGV PCR also is recommended.\\n\\nProctitis is inflammation of the rectum (i.e., the distal \\n10–12 cm) that can be associated with anorectal pain, \\ntenesmus, or rectal discharge. Fecal leukocytes are common. \\nProctitis occurs predominantly among persons who have \\nreceptive anal exposures (oral-anal, digital-anal, or genital-\\nanal). N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis (including LGV serovars), \\nHSV, and T. pallidum are the most common STI pathogens. \\nGenital HSV and LGV proctitis are more prevalent among \\npersons with HIV infection (545,556,1382). M. genitalium \\nhas been detected in certain cases of proctitis and might be \\nmore common among persons with HIV infection (937,1382). \\nN. meningitidis has been identified as an etiology of proctitis \\namong MSM with HIV infection (1383).\\n\\nProctocolitis is associated with symptoms of proctitis, \\ndiarrhea or abdominal cramps, and inflammation of the colonic \\nmucosa extending to 12 cm above the anus. Fecal leukocytes \\nmight be detected on stool examination, depending on the \\npathogen. Proctocolitis can be acquired through receptive anal \\nintercourse or by oral-anal contact, depending on the pathogen.\\n\\nPathogenic organisms include Campylobacter species, \\nShigella species, E. histolytica, LGV serovars of C. trachomatis, \\nand T. pallidum. Among immunosuppressed persons with \\nHIV infection, CMV or other opportunistic agents should \\nbe considered. The clinical presentation can be mistaken for \\n\\ninflammatory bowel disease or malignancy, resulting in a \\ndelayed diagnosis (1384,1385).\\n\\nEnteritis usually results in diarrhea and abdominal cramping \\nwithout signs of proctitis or proctocolitis. Fecal leukocytes \\nmight be detected on stool examination, depending on the \\npathogen. When outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness occur \\namong social or sexual networks of MSM, clinicians should \\nconsider sexual transmission as a mode of spread and provide \\ncounseling accordingly. Sexual practices that can facilitate \\ntransmission of enteric pathogens include oral-anal contact or, \\nin certain instances, direct genital-anal contact. G. lamblia is the \\nmost frequently implicated parasite, and bacterial pathogens \\ninclude Shigella species, Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter \\nspecies, and Cryptosporidium. Outbreaks of Shigella species, \\nCampylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and microsporidiosis have \\nbeen reported among MSM (259,274,1386,1387). Multiple \\nenteric pathogens and concurrent STIs have also been reported. \\nAmong immunosuppressed persons with HIV infection, CMV \\nor other opportunistic pathogens should be considered.\\n\\nDiagnostic and Treatment Considerations \\nfor Acute Proctitis\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nPersons with symptoms of acute proctitis should be examined \\n\\nby anoscopy. A Gram-stained smear of any anorectal exudate \\nfrom anoscopic or anal examination should be examined for \\npolymorphonuclear leukocytes. All persons should be evaluated \\nfor herpes simplex (preferably by NAAT of rectal lesions), \\nN. gonorrhoeae (NAAT or culture), C. trachomatis (NAAT), \\nand T. pallidum (darkfield of lesion if available and serologic \\ntesting). If the C. trachomatis NAAT test is positive on a rectal \\nswab and severe symptoms associated with LGV are present \\n(including rectal ulcers, anal discharge, bleeding, ≥10 WBCs \\non Gram stain, and tenesmus), patients should be treated \\nempirically for LGV. Molecular testing for LGV is not widely \\navailable or not FDA cleared, and results are not typically \\navailable in time for clinical decision-making. However, if \\navailable, molecular PCR testing for C. trachomatis serovars \\nL1, L2, or L3 can be considered for confirming LGV (553).\\n\\nThe pathogenic role of M. genitalium in proctitis is unclear. \\nFor persons with persistent symptoms after standard treatment, \\nproviders should consider testing for M. genitalium with NAAT \\nand treat if positive (see Mycoplasma genitalium).\\n\\nTreatment \\nAcute proctitis among persons who have anal exposure \\n\\nthrough oral, genital, or digital contact is usually sexually \\nacquired (1382,1388). Presumptive therapy should be \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 125US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\ninitiated while awaiting results of laboratory tests for \\npersons with anorectal exudate detected on examination or \\npolymorphonuclear leukocytes detected on a Gram-stained \\nsmear of anorectal exudate or secretions. Such therapy also \\nshould be initiated when anoscopy or Gram stain is not \\navailable and the clinical presentation is consistent with acute \\nproctitis for persons reporting receptive anal exposures.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Acute Proctitis\\n\\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\nplus\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days†\\n\\n* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.\\n† Doxycycline course should be extended to 100 mg orally 2 times/day for \\n\\n21 days in the presence of bloody discharge, perianal or mucosal ulcers, \\nor tenesmus and a positive rectal chlamydia test.\\n\\nBloody discharge, perianal ulcers, or mucosal ulcers among \\npersons with acute proctitis and rectal chlamydia (NAAT) \\nshould receive presumptive treatment for LGV with an \\nextended course of doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for \\n3 weeks (1389,1390) (see Lymphogranuloma Venereum). If \\npainful perianal ulcers are present or mucosal ulcers are \\ndetected on anoscopy, presumptive therapy should also include \\na regimen for genital herpes (see Genital Herpes).\\n\\nDiagnostic and Treatment Considerations \\nfor Proctocolitis or Enteritis\\n\\nTreatment for proctocolitis or enteritis should be directed \\nto the specific enteric pathogen identified. Multiple stool \\nexaminations might be necessary for detecting Giardia, \\nand special stool preparations are required for diagnosing \\ncryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis. Diagnostic and \\ntreatment recommendations for all enteric infections are beyond \\nthe scope of these guidelines. Providers should be aware of the \\npotential for antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, particularly \\nduring outbreaks of Shigella and Campylobacter among sexual \\nnetworks of MSM where increased resistance to azithromycin, \\nfluoroquinolones, and isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics \\nhave been described (266,272,273,1391,1392).\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nTo minimize transmission and reinfection, patients treated \\n\\nfor acute proctitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual \\nintercourse until they and their partners have been treated \\n(i.e., until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms \\nhave resolved). Studies have reported that behaviors that \\nfacilitate enteric pathogen transmission might be associated \\nwith acquisition of other STIs, including HIV infection. \\nAll persons with acute proctitis and concern for sexually \\n\\ntransmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for HIV, \\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (at other exposed sites). \\nPEP should be considered for exposures that present a risk for \\nHIV acquisition. For ongoing risk for HIV acquisition, PrEP \\nshould be considered.\\n\\nEvidence-based interventions for preventing acquisition \\nof sexually transmitted enteric pathogens are not available. \\nHowever, extrapolating from general infection control practices \\nfor communicable diseases and established STI prevention \\npractices, recommendations include avoiding contact with \\nfeces during sex, using barriers, and washing hands after \\nhanding materials that have been in contact with the anal \\narea (i.e., barriers and sex toys) and after touching the anus \\nor rectal area.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nFollow-up should be based on specific etiology and severity \\n\\nof clinical symptoms. For proctitis associated with gonorrhea \\nor chlamydia, retesting for the respective pathogen should be \\nperformed 3 months after treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nPartners who have had sexual contact with persons treated \\n\\nfor gonorrhea or chlamydia <60 days before the onset of \\nthe persons symptoms should be evaluated, tested, and \\npresumptively treated for the respective infection. Partners \\nof persons with proctitis should be evaluated for any diseases \\ndiagnosed in the index partner. Sex partners should abstain \\nfrom sexual contact until they and their partners are treated. \\nNo specific recommendations are available for screening \\nor treating sex partners of persons with diagnosed sexually \\ntransmitted enteric pathogens; however, partners should seek \\ncare if symptomatic.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\n\\nAllergic reactions with third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., \\nceftriaxone) are uncommon among persons with a history of \\npenicillin allergy (620,631,658,896).\\n\\nHIV Infection \\nPersons with HIV infection and acute proctitis might present \\n\\nwith bloody discharge, painful perianal ulcers, or mucosal \\nulcers and LGV and herpes proctitis are more prevalent among \\nthis population.

Pediculosis pubis is \\ncaused by the parasite Phthirus pubis and is usually transmitted \\nby sexual contact (1393).\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nThe clinical diagnosis is based on typical symptoms of itching \\n\\nin the pubic region. Lice and nits can be observed on pubic hair.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Pediculosis Pubis\\n\\nPermethrin 1% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off \\nafter 10 minutes\\n\\nor\\nPyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and \\nwashed off after 10 minutes\\n\\nAlternative Regimens\\n\\nMalathion 0.5% lotion applied to affected areas and washed off after \\n8–12 hours\\n\\nor\\nIvermectin 250 µg/kg body weight orally, repeated in 7–14 days\\n\\nReported resistance to pediculcides (permethrin and \\npyrethrin) has been increasing and is widespread (1394,1395). \\nMalathion can be used when treatment failure is believed to \\nhave occurred as a result of resistance. The odor and longer \\nduration of application associated with malathion therapy \\nmake it a less attractive alternative compared with the \\nrecommended pediculicides. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal \\nactivity (1396). Ivermectin might not prevent recurrences \\nfrom eggs at the time of treatment, and therefore treatment \\nshould be repeated in 7–14 days (1397,1398). Ivermectin \\nshould be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, \\nthus increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. \\nAdjustment of ivermectin dosage is not required for persons \\nwith renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses \\namong persons with severe liver disease is unknown. Lindane \\nis not recommended for treatment of pediculosis because of \\ntoxicity, contraindications for certain populations (pregnant \\nand breastfeeding women, children aged <10 years, and those \\nwith extensive dermatitis), and complexity of administration.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nThe recommended regimens should not be applied to the \\n\\neyes. Pediculosis of the eyelashes should be treated by applying \\nocclusive ophthalmic ointment or petroleum jelly to the eyelid \\n\\nmargins 2 times/day for 10 days. Bedding and clothing should \\nbe decontaminated (i.e., machine washed and dried by using \\nthe heat cycle or dry cleaned) or removed from body contact \\nfor at least 72 hours. Fumigation of living areas is unnecessary. \\nPubic hair removal has been associated with atypical patterns \\nof pubic lice infestation and decreasing incidence of infection \\n(537,1399). Persons with pediculosis pubis should be evaluated \\nfor HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nEvaluation should be performed after 1 week if symptoms \\n\\npersist. Retreatment might be necessary if lice are found or \\nif eggs are observed at the hair-skin junction. If no clinical \\nresponse is achieved to one of the recommended regimens, \\nretreatment with an alternative regimen is recommended.\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSex partners within the previous month should be treated. \\n\\nSexual contact should be avoided until patients and partners \\nhave been treated, bedding and clothing decontaminated, and \\nreevaluation performed to rule out persistent infection.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nPregnancy\\nExisting data from human participants demonstrate that \\n\\npregnant and lactating women should be treated with either \\npermethrin or pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide. Because no \\nteratogenicity or toxicity attributable to ivermectin has been \\nobserved during human pregnancy experience, ivermectin is \\nclassified as “human data suggest low risk” during pregnancy \\nand probably compatible with breastfeeding (431).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons who have pediculosis pubis and HIV infection \\n\\nshould receive the same treatment regimen as those who do \\nnot have HIV.\\n\\nScabies\\nScabies is a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes \\n\\nscabiei, which causes pruritus. Sensitization to S. scabiei occurs \\nbefore pruritus begins. The first time a person is infested with \\nS. scabiei, sensitization takes weeks to develop. However, \\npruritus might occur <24 hours after a subsequent reinfestation. \\nScabies among adults frequently is sexually acquired, although \\nscabies among children usually is not (1400–1402).\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nScabies diagnosis is made by identifying burrows, mites, eggs, \\n\\nor the mites’ feces from affected areas. Skin scrapings can be \\nexamined under the microscope to identify organisms, although \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 127US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nthis method has low sensitivity and is time consuming (1403). \\nAlternatively, noninvasive examination of the affected skin by \\nusing videodermatoscopy, videomicroscopy, or dermoscopy \\ncan be used, each of which has high sensitivity and specificity, \\nparticularly when performed by experienced operators (1404). \\nLow-technology strategies include the burrow ink test and the \\nadhesive tape test.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nRecommended Regimens for Scabies\\n\\nPermethrin 5% cream applied to all areas of the body from the neck \\ndown and washed off after 8–14 hours\\n\\nor\\nIvermectin 200 ug/kg body weight orally, repeated in 14 days*\\n\\nor\\nIvermectin 1% lotion applied to all areas of the body from the neck \\ndown and washed off after 8–14 hours; repeat treatment in 1 week if \\nsymptoms persist\\n\\n* Oral ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity; a second dose is required \\nfor eradication.\\n\\nAlternative Regimen\\n\\nLindane 1% 1 oz of lotion or 30 g of cream applied in a thin layer to all \\nareas of the body from the neck down and thoroughly washed off after \\n8 hours*\\n\\n* Infants and children aged <10 years should not be treated with lindane.\\n\\nTopical permethrin and oral and topical ivermectin have \\nsimilar efficacy for cure of scabies (1405–1410). Choice of \\ntreatment might be based on patient preference for topical \\nversus oral therapy, drug interactions with ivermectin (e.g., \\nazithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [Bactrim], or \\ncetirizine [Zytrec]), and cost. Permethrin is safe and effective \\nwith a single application (1411). Ivermectin has limited ovicidal \\nactivity and might not prevent recurrences of eggs at the time \\nof treatment; therefore, a second dose of ivermectin should be \\nadministered 14 days after the first dose (1412). Ivermectin \\nshould be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, \\nthereby increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. \\nAdjustments to ivermectin dosing are not required for patients \\nwith renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses \\namong patients with severe liver disease is unknown.\\n\\nLindane is an alternative regimen because it can cause toxicity \\n(1413); it should be used only if the patient cannot tolerate \\nthe recommended therapies or if these therapies have failed \\n(1414–1416). Lindane is not recommended for pregnant and \\nbreastfeeding women, children aged <10 years, and persons \\nwith extensive dermatitis. Seizures have occurred when lindane \\nwas applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive \\ndermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been \\nreported (1413). Lindane resistance has been reported in some \\nareas of the world, including parts of the United States (1413).\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nBedding and clothing should be decontaminated (i.e., \\n\\neither machine washed and dried by using the heat cycle or \\ndry cleaned) or removed from body contact for >72 hours. \\nFumigation of living areas is unnecessary. Persons with scabies \\nshould be advised to keep fingernails closely trimmed to reduce \\ninjury from excessive scratching (1417).\\n\\nCrusted Scabies\\nCrusted scabies is an aggressive infestation that usually \\n\\noccurs among immunodeficient, debilitated, or malnourished \\npersons, including persons receiving systemic or potent topical \\nglucocorticoids, organ transplant recipients, persons with HIV \\ninfection or human T-lymphotrophic virus-1 infection, and \\npersons with hematologic malignancies. Crusted scabies is \\ntransmitted more easily than scabies (1418). No controlled \\ntherapeutic studies for crusted scabies have been conducted, \\nand a recommended treatment remains unclear. Substantial \\ntreatment failure might occur with a single-dose topical \\nscabicide or with oral ivermectin treatment. Combination \\ntreatment is recommended with a topical scabicide, either 5% \\ntopical permethrin cream (full-body application to be repeated \\ndaily for 7 days then 2 times/week until cure) or 25% topical \\nbenzyl benzoate, and oral ivermectin 200 ug/kg body weight on \\ndays 1, 2, 8, 9, and 15. Additional ivermectin treatment on days \\n22 and 29 might be required for severe cases (1419). Lindane \\nshould be avoided because of the risks for neurotoxicity with \\nheavy applications on denuded skin.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nThe rash and pruritus of scabies might persist for <2 weeks \\n\\nafter treatment. Symptoms or signs persisting for >2 weeks \\ncan be attributed to multiple factors. Treatment failure \\ncan occur as a result of resistance to medication or faulty \\napplication of topical scabicides. These medications do not \\neasily penetrate into thick, scaly skin of persons with crusted \\nscabies, perpetuating the harboring of mites in these difficult-\\nto-penetrate layers. In the absence of recommended contact \\ntreatment and decontamination of bedding and clothing, \\npersisting symptoms can be attributed to reinfection by family \\nmembers or fomites. Finally, other household mites can cause \\nsymptoms to persist as a result of cross-reactivity between \\nantigens. Even when treatment is successful, reinfection is \\navoided, and cross-reactivity does not occur, symptoms can \\npersist or worsen as a result of allergic dermatitis.\\n\\nRetreatment 2 weeks after the initial treatment regimen can \\nbe considered for those persons who are still symptomatic or \\nwhen live mites are observed. Use of an alternative regimen is \\nrecommended for those persons who do not respond initially \\nto the recommended treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n128 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nManagement of Sex Partners and \\nHousehold Contacts\\n\\nPersons who have had sexual, close personal, or household \\ncontact with the patient within the month preceding scabies \\ninfestation should be examined. Those identified as being \\ninfested should be provided treatment.\\n\\nManagement of Outbreaks in Communities, \\nNursing Homes, and Other Institutional Settings\\n\\nScabies epidemics frequently occur in nursing homes, \\nhospitals, residential facilities, and other communities \\n(1420,1421). Control of an epidemic can only be achieved \\nby treating the entire population at risk. Ivermectin can be \\nconsidered in these settings, especially if treatment with topical \\nscabicides fails. Mass treatment with oral ivermectin is highly \\neffective in decreasing prevalence in settings where scabies is \\nendemic (1422). Epidemics should be managed in consultation \\nwith a specialist.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nInfants, Young Children, and Pregnant or \\nLactating Women\\n\\nInfants and young children should be treated with \\npermethrin; the safety of ivermectin for children weighing \\n<15 kg has not been determined. Infants and children aged \\n<10 years should not be treated with lindane. Ivermectin likely \\nposes a low risk to pregnant women and is likely compatible \\nwith breastfeeding; however, because of limited data regarding \\nivermectin use for pregnant and lactating women, permethrin \\nis the preferred treatment (431) (see Pediculosis Pubis).\\n\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with HIV infection who have uncomplicated scabies \\n\\nshould receive the same treatment regimens as those who do \\nnot have HIV. Persons with HIV infection and others who are \\nimmunosuppressed are at increased risk for crusted scabies and \\nshould be managed in consultation with a specialist.\\n\\nSexual Assault and Abuse and STIs\\nAdolescents and Adults\\n\\nThese guidelines are primarily limited to the identification, \\nprophylaxis, and treatment of STIs and conditions among \\nadolescent and adult female sexual assault survivors. However, \\nsome of the following guidelines might still apply to male \\nsexual assault survivors. Documentation of findings, collection \\nof nonmicrobiologic specimens for forensic purposes, \\nand management of potential pregnancy or physical and \\n\\npsychological trauma are beyond the scope of these guidelines. \\nExaminations of survivors of sexual assault should be \\nconducted by an experienced clinician in a way that minimizes \\nfurther trauma to the person. The decision to obtain genital \\nor other specimens for STI diagnosis should be made on an \\nindividual basis. Care systems for survivors should be designed \\nto ensure continuity, including timely review of test results, \\nsupport adherence, and monitoring for adverse reactions to \\nany prescribed therapeutic or prophylactic regimens. Laws in \\nall 50 states limit the evidentiary use of a survivor’s previous \\nsexual history, including evidence of previously acquired STIs, \\nas part of an effort to undermine the credibility of the survivor’s \\ntestimony. Evidentiary privilege against revealing any aspect of \\nthe examination or treatment also is enforced in most states. \\nAlthough it rarely occurs, STI diagnoses might later be accessed, \\nand the survivor and clinician might opt to defer testing for this \\nreason. Although collection of specimens at initial examination \\nfor laboratory STI diagnosis gives the survivor and clinician \\nthe option of deferring empiric prophylactic antimicrobial \\ntreatment, compliance with follow-up visits is typically poor \\n(1423–1425). Among sexually active adults, identification \\nof an STI might represent an infection acquired before the \\nassault, and therefore might be more important for the medical \\nmanagement of the patient than for legal purposes.\\n\\nTrichomoniasis, BV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are the \\nmost frequently diagnosed infections among women who \\nhave been sexually assaulted. Such conditions are prevalent \\namong the population, and detection of these infections \\nafter an assault does not necessarily imply acquisition during \\nthe assault. However, a postassault examination presents an \\nimportant opportunity for identifying or preventing an STI. \\nChlamydial and gonococcal infections among women are \\nof particular concern because of the possibility of ascending \\ninfection. In addition, HBV infection can be prevented \\nthrough postexposure vaccination (see Hepatitis B Virus \\nInfection). Because persons who have been sexually assaulted \\nalso are at risk for acquiring HPV infection, and the efficacy \\nof the HPV vaccine is high (1426,1427), HPV vaccination is \\nalso recommended for females and males through age 26 years \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/\\nhpv.html) (11). Reproductive-aged female survivors should be \\nevaluated for pregnancy and offered emergency contraception.\\n\\nEvaluating Adolescents and Adults for STIs\\n\\nInitial Examination\\nDecisions to perform the following tests should be made on \\n\\nan individual basis. An initial examination after a sexual assault \\nmight include the following:\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 129US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n• NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae at the sites \\nof penetration or attempted penetration should be \\nperformed (553). These tests are preferred for diagnostic \\nevaluation of adolescent or adult sexual assault survivors.\\n\\n• Females should be offered NAAT testing for T. vaginalis \\nfrom a urine or vaginal specimen. POC or wet mount with \\nmeasurement of vaginal pH and KOH application for the \\nwhiff test from vaginal secretions should be performed for \\nevidence of BV and candidiasis, especially if vaginal \\ndischarge, malodor, or itching is present.\\n\\n• MSM should be offered screening for C. trachomatis and \\nN. gonorrhoeae if they report receptive oral or anal sex \\nduring the preceding year, regardless of whether sexual \\ncontact occurred at these anatomic sites during the assault. \\nAnoscopy should be considered in instances of reported \\nanal penetration.\\n\\n• A serum sample should be performed for HIV, HBV, and \\nsyphilis infection.\\n\\nTreatment\\nCompliance with follow-up visits is poor among survivors \\n\\nof sexual assault (1423–1425). Consequently, the following \\nroutine presumptive treatments after a sexual assault are \\nrecommended:\\n\\n• An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, \\ngonorrhea, and trichomonas for women and chlamydia \\nand gonorrhea for men.\\n\\n• Emergency contraception should be considered when the \\nassault could result in pregnancy (see Emergency \\nContraception).\\n\\n• Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination (without HBIG) if \\nthe hepatitis status of the assailant is unknown and the \\nsurvivor has not been previously vaccinated. If the assailant \\nis known to be HBsAg positive, unvaccinated survivors \\nshould receive both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. The \\nvaccine and HBIG, if indicated, should be administered \\nto sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial \\nexamination, and follow-up doses of vaccine should be \\nadministered 1–2 and 4–6 months after the first dose. \\nSurvivors who were previously vaccinated but did not \\nreceive postvaccination testing should receive a single \\nvaccine booster dose (see Hepatitis B Virus Infection).\\n\\n• HPV vaccination for female and male survivors aged \\n9–26 years who have not been vaccinated or are \\nincompletely vaccinated (11) (https://www.cdc.gov/\\nvaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html). The \\nvaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors \\nat the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses \\nshould be administered at 1–2 months and 6 months after \\nthe first dose. A 2-dose schedule (0 and 6–12 months) is \\n\\nrecommended for persons initiating vaccination before \\nage 15 years.\\n\\n• Recommendations for HIV PEP are made on a case-by-\\ncase basis according to risk (see Risk for Acquiring HIV \\nInfection; Recommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk \\nAssessment of Adolescents and Adults <72 Hours After \\nSexual Assault). \\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Female \\nSexual Assault Survivors\\n\\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\nplus\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days\\nplus\\n\\nMetronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days\\n\\n* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.\\n\\nRecommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Male Sexual \\nAssault Survivors\\n\\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\nplus\\n\\nDoxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days\\n\\n* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.\\n\\nClinicians should counsel persons regarding the possible \\nbenefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; \\ngastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination. \\nThe efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after \\nsexual assault has not been evaluated. For those requiring \\nalternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this \\nreport relevant to the specific organisms.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAt the initial examination and, if indicated, at follow-up \\n\\nexaminations, patients should be counseled regarding \\nsymptoms of STIs and the need for immediate examination if \\nsymptoms occur. Further, they should be instructed to abstain \\nfrom sexual intercourse until STI prophylactic treatment \\nis completed.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nAfter the initial postassault examination, follow-up \\n\\nexaminations provide an opportunity to detect new infections \\nacquired during or after the assault, complete hepatitis B \\nand HPV vaccinations, if indicated, complete counseling \\nand treatment for other STIs, and monitor side effects and \\nadherence to PEP, if prescribed. If initial testing was performed, \\nfollow-up evaluation should be conducted in <1 week to ensure \\nthat results of positive tests can be discussed promptly with \\nthe survivor, treatment is provided if not administered at the \\ninitial visit, and any follow-up for infections can be arranged. \\nIf initial tests are negative and treatment was not provided, \\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n130 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nexamination for STIs can be repeated 1–2 weeks after the \\nassault; repeat testing detects infectious organisms that might \\nnot have reached sufficient concentrations to produce positive \\ntest results at the time of initial examination. For survivors who \\nare treated during the initial visit, regardless of whether testing \\nwas performed, posttreatment testing should be conducted \\nonly if the person reports having symptoms. If initial test results \\nwere negative and infection in the assailant cannot be ruled \\nout, serologic tests for syphilis can be repeated at 4–6 weeks \\nand 3 months; HIV testing can be repeated at 6 weeks and at \\n3 months by using methods to identify acute HIV infection.\\n\\nRisk for Acquiring HIV Infection\\nHIV seroconversion has occurred among persons whose only \\n\\nknown risk factor was sexual assault or sexual abuse; however, \\nthe frequency of this occurrence likely is low (1428,1429). In \\nconsensual sex, the per-act risk for HIV transmission from \\nvaginal intercourse is 0.08%, and for receptive anal intercourse, \\n1.38% (192). The per-act risk for HIV transmission from \\noral sex is substantially lower. Specific circumstances of an \\nassault (e.g., bleeding, which often accompanies trauma) \\nmight increase risk for HIV transmission in cases involving \\nvaginal, anal, or oral penetration. Site of exposure to ejaculate, \\nviral load in ejaculate, and the presence of an STI or genital \\nlesions in the assailant or survivor also might increase risk for \\nHIV acquisition.\\n\\nPEP with a 28-day course of zidovudine was associated with \\nan 81% reduction in risk for acquiring HIV in a study of health \\ncare workers who had percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected \\nblood (1430). On the basis of these results and results from \\nanimal studies, PEP has been recommended for health care \\nworkers who have occupational exposures to HIV (1431). \\nThese findings have been extrapolated to nonoccupational \\ninjecting drug and sexual HIV exposures, including sexual \\nassault. The possibility of HIV exposure from the assault should \\nbe assessed at the initial examination; survivors determined \\nto be at risk for acquiring HIV should be informed about the \\npossible benefit of PEP in preventing HIV infection. Initiation \\nof PEP as soon as possible after the exposure increases the \\nlikelihood of prophylactic benefit.\\n\\nMultiple factors affect the medical recommendation for \\nPEP and affect the assault survivor’s acceptance of that \\nrecommendation. These factors include the likelihood of the \\nassailant having HIV, any exposure characteristics that might \\nincrease the risk for HIV transmission, the time elapsed after \\nthe event, and the potential benefits and risks associated \\nwith PEP (1431). Determination of the assailant’s HIV \\nstatus at the time of the postassault examination is usually \\nnot possible. Therefore, health care providers should assess \\nany available information concerning the characteristics and \\n\\nHIV risk behaviors of the assailant (e.g., being an MSM or \\nusing injecting drugs), local epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, and \\nexposure characteristics of the assault. When an assailant’s \\nHIV status is unknown, determinations about risk for HIV \\ntransmission to the survivor should be based on whether vaginal \\nor anal penetration occurred; whether ejaculation occurred on \\nmucous membranes; whether multiple assailants were involved; \\nwhether mucosal lesions were present in the assailant or \\nsurvivor; and any other characteristics of the assault, survivor, \\nor assailant that might increase risk for HIV transmission.\\n\\nIf PEP is offered, the following information should be \\ndiscussed with the survivor: the necessity of early initiation \\nof PEP to optimize potential benefits (i.e., as soon as possible \\nafter and <72 hours after the assault), the importance of close \\nfollow-up, the benefit of adherence to recommended dosing, \\nand potential adverse effects of antiretroviral medications. \\nProviders should emphasize that severe adverse effects are \\nrare from PEP (1431–1435). Clinical management of the \\nsurvivor should be implemented according to the HIV PEP \\nguidelines and in collaboration with specialists (1436). Health \\ncare providers should provide an initial course of 3–7 days of \\nmedication (i.e., a starter pack) with a prescription for the \\nremainder of the course, or, if starter packs are unavailable, \\nthey should provide a prescription for an entire 28-day \\ncourse. Provision of the entire 28-day PEP medication supply \\nat the initial visit has been reported to increase likelihood of \\nadherence, especially when patients have difficulty returning \\nfor multiple follow-up visits (1437). Routinely providing \\nstarter packs or the entire 28-day course requires that health \\ncare providers stock PEP drugs in their practice setting or have \\nan established agreement with a pharmacy to stock, package, \\nand urgently dispense PEP drugs with required administration \\ninstructions. Uninsured patients or those with high copayments \\ncan be enrolled in a patient-assistance program to ensure \\naccess to PEP medications. An early follow-up visit should be \\nscheduled at which health care providers can discuss the results \\nof HIV and STI testing, provide additional counseling and \\nsupport, provide indicated vaccines not administered at the \\ninitial evaluation, assess medication side effects and adherence, \\nor provide an altered PEP medication regimen if indicated by \\nside effects or laboratory test results.\\n\\nRecommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk \\nAssessment of Adolescents and Adults <72 Hours \\nAfter Sexual Assault\\n\\nHealth care providers should do the following:\\n• Assess risk for HIV infection in the assailant, and test that \\n\\nperson for HIV whenever possible.\\n• Use the algorithm to evaluate the survivor for the need for \\n\\nHIV PEP (Figure) (1436).\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 131US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n• Consult with a specialist in HIV treatment if PEP is being \\nconsidered.\\n\\n• If the survivor appears to be at risk for acquiring HIV from \\nthe assault, discuss PEP, including benefits and risks.\\n\\n• If the survivor chooses to start PEP, provide an initial \\ncourse of 3–7 days of medication (i.e., a starter pack) with \\na prescription for the remainder of the course or provide \\na prescription for an entire 28-day course.

Investigation of sexual abuse \\namong children who have an infection that might have been \\ntransmitted sexually should be conducted in compliance with \\nrecommendations by clinicians who have experience and \\ntraining in all elements of the evaluation of child abuse, neglect, \\nand assault. The social significance of an infection that might \\nhave been acquired sexually varies by the specific organism, as \\ndoes the threshold for reporting suspected child sexual abuse \\n(Table 8). When any STI has been diagnosed in a child, efforts \\nshould be made in consultation with a specialist to evaluate \\nthe possibility of sexual abuse, including conducting a history \\nand physical examination for evidence of abuse and diagnostic \\ntesting for other commonly occurring STIs (1439–1441).\\n\\nThe general rule that STIs beyond the neonatal period are \\nevidence of sexual abuse has exceptions. For example, genital \\ninfection with T. vaginalis (1442) or rectal or genital infection \\nwith C. trachomatis among young children might be the result \\nof perinatally acquired infection and has, in certain cases \\nof chlamydial infection, persisted for as long as 2–3 years \\n(1443–1445), although perinatal chlamydial infection is now \\nuncommon because of prenatal screening and treatment of \\npregnant women. Genital warts have been diagnosed among \\nchildren who have been sexually abused (1426) but also \\namong children who have no other evidence of sexual abuse \\n(1446,1447); lesions appearing for the first time in a child \\naged >5 years are more likely to have been caused by sexual \\ntransmission (1448). BV has been diagnosed among children \\n\\nwho have been abused but its presence alone does not prove \\nsexual abuse. The majority of HBV infections among children \\nresult from household exposure to persons who have chronic \\nHBV infection rather than sexual abuse.\\n\\nReporting\\nAll U.S. states and territories have laws that require reporting \\n\\nof child abuse. Although the exact requirements differ by state \\nor territory, if a health care provider has reasonable cause to \\nsuspect child abuse, a report must be made (1448). Health care \\nproviders should contact their state or local child protection \\nservice agency regarding child abuse reporting requirements.\\n\\nEvaluating Children for STIs\\nEvaluating children for sexual assault or abuse should be \\n\\nconducted in a manner designed to minimize pain and trauma \\nto the child. Examinations and collection of vaginal specimens \\nin prepubertal girls can be extremely uncomfortable and should \\nbe performed by an experienced clinician to avoid psychological \\nand physical trauma to the child. The decision to obtain genital \\nor other specimens from a child to evaluate for STIs should be \\nmade on an individual basis. However, children who received \\na diagnosis of one STI should be screened for other STIs. \\nHistory and reported type of sexual contact might not be a \\nreliable indicator, and urogenital, pharyngeal, and rectal testing \\nshould be considered for preverbal children and children who \\ncannot verbalize details of the assault (1438,1449). Factors that \\nshould lead the physician to consider testing for STIs include \\nthe following (1449):\\n\\n• The child has experienced penetration or has evidence of \\nrecent or healed penetrative injury to the genitals, anus, \\nor oropharynx.\\n\\n• The child has been abused by a stranger.\\n\\nTABLE 8.

Because of the legal and \\npsychosocial consequences of a false-positive diagnosis, only \\ntests with high specificities should be used. The potential \\nbenefit to the child of a reliable STI diagnosis justifies deferring \\npresumptive treatment until specimens for highly specific tests \\nare obtained by providers with experience in evaluating sexually \\nabused and assaulted children.\\n\\nEvaluations should be performed on a case-by-case basis, \\naccording to history of assault or abuse and in a manner \\nthat minimizes the possibility for psychological trauma and \\nsocial stigma. If the initial exposure was recent, the infectious \\norganisms acquired through the exposure might not have \\nproduced sufficient concentrations to result in positive test \\nresults or examination findings (1450). Alternatively, positive \\ntest results after a recent exposure might represent the assailant’s \\nsecretions (but would nonetheless be an indication for \\ntreatment of the child). A second visit approximately 2–6 weeks \\nafter the most recent sexual exposure should be scheduled \\nto include a repeat physical examination and collection of \\nadditional specimens to identify any infection that might not \\nhave been detected at the time of initial evaluation. A single \\nevaluation might be sufficient if the child was abused for an \\nextended period and if a substantial amount of time elapsed \\nbetween the last suspected episode of abuse and the medical \\nevaluation. Compliance with follow-up appointments might be \\nimproved when law enforcement personnel or child protective \\nservices are involved.\\n\\nInitial Examination\\nVisual inspection of the genital, perianal, and oral areas \\n\\nfor genital discharge, odor, bleeding, irritation, warts, \\nand ulcerative lesions should be performed during initial \\nexamination. The clinical manifestations of certain STIs are \\ndifferent for children than for adults. For example, typical \\n\\nvesicular lesions might be absent even in the presence of HSV \\ninfection. The following should be performed during the initial \\nexamination, if STI testing is indicated:\\n\\n• Testing for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis can be \\nperformed from specimens collected from the pharynx \\nand rectum, as well as the vagina for girls and urine for \\nboys. Cervical specimens are not recommended for \\nprepubertal girls. For boys with a urethral discharge, a \\nmeatal specimen discharge is an adequate substitute for \\nan intraurethral swab specimen. Culture or NAAT can be \\nused to test for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. \\nAlthough data regarding NAAT for children are more \\nlimited and performance is test dependent (553), no \\nevidence demonstrates that performance of NAAT for \\ndetection of N. gonorrhoea or C. trachomatis among \\nchildren differs from that among adults. Only FDA-cleared \\nNAAT assays should be used. Consultation with an expert \\nis necessary before using NAAT in this context, both to \\nminimize the possibility of cross-reaction with \\nnongonococcal Neisseria species and other commensals \\n(e.g., N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. lactamica, N. cinerea, \\nor M. catarrhalis) and to ensure correct interpretation of \\nresults. Because of the implications of a diagnosis of \\nN. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection in a child, only \\nCLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAATs should be used \\n(837). If culture for the isolation of N. gonorrhoeae or \\nC. trachomatis is performed, only standard culture \\nprocedures should be followed. Specimens from the vagina, \\nurethra, pharynx, or rectum should be streaked onto \\nselective media for isolation of N. gonorrhoeae, and all \\npresumptive isolates of N. gonorrhoeae should be identified \\ndefinitively by at least two tests that involve different \\napproaches (e.g., biochemical, enzyme substrate, or \\nmolecular probes). Gram stains are inadequate for \\nevaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should \\nnot be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. Specimens \\n(either NAAT or culture, including any isolates) obtained \\nbefore treatment should be preserved for further validation \\nif needed. When a specimen is positive, the result should \\nbe confirmed either by retesting the original specimen or \\nobtaining another. Because of the overall low prevalence \\nof N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among children, \\nfalse-positive results can occur, and all specimens that are \\ninitially positive should be confirmed.\\n\\n• Testing for T. vaginalis should not be limited to girls with \\nvaginal discharge if other indications for vaginal testing \\nexist because evidence indicates that asymptomatic sexually \\nabused children might be infected with T. vaginalis and \\nmight benefit from treatment (1451,1452). NAAT can \\nbe used as an alternative or in addition to culture and wet \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\n134 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\nmount, especially in settings where culture and wet mount \\nof vaginal swab specimens are not obtainable. Data \\nregarding use of NAATs for detection of T. vaginalis among \\nchildren are limited; however, no evidence indicates that \\nperformance of NAAT for detection of T. vaginalis for \\nchildren would differ from that for adults. Consultation \\nwith an expert is necessary before using NAAT in this \\ncontext to ensure correct interpretation of results. Because \\nof the implications of a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection in \\na child, only CLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAATs should \\nbe used (837). POC tests for T. vaginalis have not been \\nvalidated for prepubertal children and should not be used. \\nIn the case of a positive specimen, the result should be \\nconfirmed either by retesting the original specimen or \\nobtaining another. Because of the overall low prevalence of \\nT. vaginalis among children, false-positive results can occur, \\nand all specimens that are initially positive should \\nbe confirmed.\\n\\n• HSV can be indicative of sexual abuse; therefore, \\nspecimens should be obtained from all vesicular or \\nulcerative genital or perianal lesions and sent for NAAT \\nor viral culture.\\n\\n• Wet mount can be used for a vaginal swab specimen for \\nBV if discharge is present.\\n\\n• Collection of serum samples should be evaluated, preserved \\nfor subsequent analysis, and used as a baseline for \\ncomparison with follow-up serologic tests. Sera can be tested \\nfor antibodies to T. pallidum, HIV, and HBV. Decisions \\nregarding the infectious agents for which to perform \\nserologic tests should be made on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nTreatment\\nThe risk for a child acquiring an STI as a result of sexual \\n\\nabuse or assault has not been well studied. Presumptive \\ntreatment for children who have been sexually assaulted or \\nabused is not recommended because the incidence of most \\nSTIs among children is low after abuse or assault, prepubertal \\ngirls appear to be at lower risk for ascending infection than \\nadolescent or adult women, and regular follow-up of children \\nusually can be ensured. However, certain children or their \\nparent or guardian might be concerned about the possibility \\nof infection with an STI, even if the health care provider \\nhas perceived the risk to be low. Such concerns might be an \\nindication for presumptive treatment in certain settings and \\nmight be considered after all relevant specimens for diagnostic \\ntests have been collected.\\n\\nOther Management Considerations\\nChildren who are survivors of sexual assault or abuse are at \\n\\nincreased risk for future unsafe sexual practices that have been \\n\\nlinked to higher risk for HPV acquisition (1426,1453) and \\nare more likely to engage in these behaviors at an earlier age; \\ntherefore, ACIP recommends vaccination of these children \\nat age ≥9 years if they have not initiated or completed HPV \\nvaccination (see Human Papillomavirus Infections, Prevention) \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/\\nhpv.html). Although HPV vaccine will not protect against \\nprogression of infection already acquired or promote clearance \\nof the infection, the vaccine protects against HPV types not \\nyet acquired.\\n\\nFollow-Up\\nIf no infections were identified at the initial examination \\n\\nafter the last suspected sexual exposure, and if this exposure \\nwas recent, a follow-up evaluation approximately 2 weeks \\nafter the last exposure can be considered. Likewise, if no \\nphysical examination or diagnostic testing was performed \\nat the initial visit, a complete examination can be scheduled \\napproximately 2 weeks after the last exposure to identify any \\nevidence of STIs. In circumstances in which transmission of \\nsyphilis, HIV, HBV, or HPV is a concern but baseline tests \\nfor syphilis, HIV, and HBV are negative and examinations \\nfor genital warts are negative, follow-up serologic testing and \\nexamination approximately 6 weeks and <3 months after the \\nlast suspected sexual exposure is recommended to allow time \\nfor antibodies to develop and signs of infection to appear. \\nIn addition, results of HBsAg testing should be interpreted \\ncarefully because HBV can be transmitted nonsexually. \\nDecisions regarding which tests should be performed should \\nbe made on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nRisk for Acquiring HIV Infection\\nHIV has been reported among children for whom sexual \\n\\nabuse was the only known risk factor. Serologic testing for HIV \\nshould be considered for sexually abused children. The decision \\nto test for HIV should involve the family, if possible, and be \\nmade on a case-by-case basis depending on the likelihood \\nof infection in the assailant (1448,1454). Although data are \\ninsufficient concerning the efficacy of PEP among children, \\ntreatment is well tolerated by infants and children with and \\nwithout HIV, and children have a minimal risk for serious \\nadverse reactions because of the short period recommended \\nfor prophylaxis (1455).\\n\\nRecommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk \\nAssessment of Children <72 Hours After \\nSexual Assault\\n\\nProviders should do the following:\\n• Review local HIV epidemiology, assess risk for HIV in the \\n\\nassailant, and test for HIV.\\n\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html\\n\\n\\nRecommendations and Reports\\n\\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 135US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\\n• Evaluate the circumstances of the assault or abuse that \\nmight affect risk for HIV transmission.\\n\\n• Perform HIV antigen or antibody testing (or antibody \\ntesting, if antigen or antibody testing is unavailable) during \\nthe original assessment and again at follow-up visits, in \\naccordance with CDC guidelines (https://stacks.cdc.gov/\\nview/cdc/38856). In considering whether to offer PEP, \\nhealth care providers should consider whether the child \\ncan be treated soon after the sexual exposure (i.e., \\n<72 hours), the likelihood that the assailant has HIV \\ninfection, and the likelihood of high compliance with the \\nprophylactic regimen (1436). Potential benefit of treating \\na sexually abused child should be weighed against the risk \\nfor adverse reactions.\\n\\n• Consult with a provider specializing in evaluating or \\ntreating children with HIV infection to determine age-\\nappropriate dosing and regimens and baseline laboratory \\ntesting, if PEP is being considered.\\n\\n• Discuss PEP with the caregivers, including its toxicity, \\nunknown efficacy, and possible benefits, for children \\ndetermined to be at risk for HIV transmission from the \\nassault or abuse.\\n\\n• Provided adequate doses of medication, if PEP is begun, \\nto last until the follow-up visit 3–7 days after the initial \\nassessment, at which time the child should be reevaluated \\nand tolerance of medication assessed (139).\\n\\nConflicts of Interest\\n\\nAll authors have completed and submitted the International \\nCommittee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of \\npotential conflicts of interest.
